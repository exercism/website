This is the website component of Exercism. It is Ruby on Rails app, backed by MySQL. It also relies on Redis and AnyCable.

## Running within our development-environment

Our supported development setup is via our [development environment](https://github.com/exercism/development-environment) repo. Please follow the instructions there. _You can also run locally without Docker, but this is unsupported - see the next section for details._

### Setup database

Assuming your docker-compose is already "up," you can run the following commands from the `development-environment` directory to setup the database. All these are run "inside" the existing `website` container that needs to already have been started.

```sh
# seed the database
./bin/script website seed-db

# reset the database (drop -> migrate -> seed)
./bin/script website reset-db
```

### Running tests

Assuming your docker-compose is already "up," you can run the following commands from the `development-environment` directory to run tests. All these are run "inside" the existing `website` container that needs to already have been started.

```sh
# run rubocop to lint the codebase
./bin/script website lint

# run rails test
./bin/script website run-tests

# run rails test:system
./bin/script website run-system-tests

# run yarn test
./bin/script website run-js-tests
```

#### Running single tests

Often you only want to run the tests in a single file. You can do that by passing an additional argument to the scripts:

```bash
# run rails test test/commands/track/create_test.rb
./bin/script website run-tests test/commands/track/create_test.rb

# run rails test:system test/system/components/tooltips/tooltip_test.rb
./bin/script website run-system-tests test/system/components/tooltips/tooltip_test.rb

# run yarn test test/javascript/components/student/TracksList/Track.test.js
./bin/script website run-js-tests test/javascript/components/student/TracksList/Track.test.js
```

### Local setup

The website can be also be setup and run locally. This is unsupported.
You need the following installed:

- Ruby 2.6.6 (For other Ruby versions, change the version in the `Gemfile`)
- MySQL
- Redis
- [AnyCable-Go](https://github.com/anycable/anycable-go#installation)
- [DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html)
- [S3Mock](https://github.com/adobe/s3mock)

Run localstack for a local AWS:

```bash
docker run -dp 3042:8080 -p 3040:4566 -p 3041:4566 localstack/localstack
```

#### Mac-Specific

The main dependencies can be installed via homebrew

- `brew install libgit2 cmake pkg-config anycable-go hivemind`

#### Configure the database

Running these commands inside a mysql console will get a working database setup:

```bash
CREATE USER 'exercism_v3'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'exercism_v3';
CREATE DATABASE exercism_v3_development;
ALTER DATABASE exercism_v3_development CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON exercism_v3_development.* TO 'exercism_v3'@'localhost';

CREATE DATABASE `exercism_v3_test`;
ALTER DATABASE `exercism_v3_test` CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `exercism_v3_test`.* TO 'exercism_v3'@'localhost';
```

Tests are parallelized so you need a db per processor, so you need to do this for `n` processors.

```bash
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `exercism_v3_test-0`.* TO 'exercism_v3'@'localhost';
```

#### Run the setup script

Run the setup scripts:

```
bundle install
EXERCISM_ENV=development bundle exec setup_exercism_config
EXERCISM_ENV=development bundle exec setup_exercism_local_aws
```

**Note: you will need to do this every time you reset dynamodb, which happens when Docker is restarted.**

#### Running the local servers

We have a Procfile which executes the various commands need to run Exercism locally.
On MacOSX we recommend using `hivemind` to manage this, which can be installed via `brew install hivemind`.

To get everything started you can then run:

```bash
hivemind -p 3020 Procfile.dev
```

## Configure Solargraph

If you'd like to use solargraph, the gem is in the file. You need to run and set `solargraph.useBundler` to `true` in your config. I have this working well with coc-solargraph. [This article](http://blog.jamesnewton.com/setting-up-coc-nvim-for-ruby-development) was helpful for setting it up.

- `bundle exec yard gems`
- `solargraph bundle`

## Code Standards

Rubocop is enforced on Pull Requests. To run it locally:

```
bundle exec rubocop --except Metrics
```

To autoupdate based on it's suggestions, add the `-a` flag:

```
bundle exec rubocop --except Metrics -a
```

To check the complexity of your code and ensure you're not
adding things that are more complex to the codebase, run without the `--except` flag:

```
bundle exec rubocop -a
```

## Testing

The tests can be run using:

```
bundle exec rails test
```

### Git Repos

If you need to create a new Git repo for use in the tests, use the following:

```
mkdir /Users/iHiD/Code/exercism/website/test/repos/new-repo
cd /Users/iHiD/Code/exercism/website/test/repos/new-repo
git init --bare

cd ~
git clone file:///Users/iHiD/Code/exercism/website/test/repos/new-repo exercism-new-git-repo
cd exercism-new-git-repo
echo "{}" > config.json
git add config.json
git commit -m "First commit"
git push origin head
```
