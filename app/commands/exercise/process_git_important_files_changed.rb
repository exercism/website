  # We are calling this file because the git important hash of an exercise has changed.
  # That means that some important files have changed. Depending on which files, and
  # whether the maintainer has set different flags, we need to set different behaviours.
  #
  # There are two scenarios.
  # 1. The first is that the testable files have changed (e.g. the tests or
  #    some build file). In this sceneario, we need to rerun all the tests and
  #    mark things out of date.
  # 2. Things haven't changed, either because only the docs have changed,
  #    or because
  def call
    # Maintainers can specify a flag that says "although it looks like things have
    # changed, they haven't really". This is used for example when the file only contains
    # whitespace changes, or grammar changes.
    # The same situation applies if only documentation has changed.
    # In these scenarios, we want to update all the solution files to just have the
    # new hash and do nothing else. The user will never know anything has happened.

    # In other scenarios, we do need to retest everything, and also update the
    # indexes to mark things out of date.

    # and reprocess all the head test runs, and it should be fast.
    # So we do it in bands here.
