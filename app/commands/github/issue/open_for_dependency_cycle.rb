          We found a concept prerequisite cycle in the `config.json` file in commit #{track.synced_to_git_sha}.

          Such a cycle occurs when Concept Exercise A teaches concept X and has concept Y as a prerequisite, whereas Concept Exercise B teaches concept Y and has concept X as a prerequisite. The cycle can also be indirect, in which case there are intermediate Concept Exercises involved.

          These prerequisite cycles should be removed to have the track work properly on the website.

          Please tag @exercism/maintainers-admin if you require more information.
