            This task is perfect for people making their first contribution to

            You'll need to know a little bit about how Exercism works, but you
            can work it out during this task. Perfect for first-time
            contributors.

            You'll need to know the key principles of{' '}
            {desc ? desc : 'this area'} to work on this task. If you're not
            familiar, you can learn while doing the task but you might need to
            put in a couple of hours of reading the docs to get up to speed.

            You'll need to have a solid understanding of
            {desc ? desc : 'this area'} to work on this task. If you don't,
            you'll probably need to pair up with someone more experienced to
            work on it.
