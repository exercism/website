        %strong Become Exercism's Community Manager!
        We need someone to lead, grow and nurture our community of students, mentors and contributors.
        If you're passionate about community, love people, and are excited about taking a systematic approach to creating a kind, supportive and helpful community, then this role might be perfect for you!

      %h2.text-h2.mb-12 Summary
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        Exercism is a not-for-profit organisation providing world-class programming education to anyone for free.
        Our online platform is centred around self-directed learning and volunteer mentoring, and has nearly one million members.
        Over the next 5 years, we want to become the defacto programming education platform that anyone, anywhere can use for free.
        Through our work we aim to improve the global standard of programming and increase participation in tech from under-represented groups.
        You can learn more about Exercism in our #{link_to '"About Exercism" pages', 'https://exercism.org/about', target: '_blank', rel: :noopener}.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        At its core, Exercism is a community.
        Our contributors have created thousands of exercises, our mentors have given feedback in millions of discussions, and our students have helped and supported each other.
        As we now start to scale and grow, we need a full-time community manager to be at the centre of this community, supporting our volunteers and designing systems that allow and encourage our students to support each other.
        Over the last decade we've built solid foundations, but there is so much more that we want to do, and we want someone who can take the lead on making that a reality.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-32
        We are building an exceptional team of ambitious, passionate people who love their work, excel at what they do, and have fun doing it.
        The values of empathy, integrity and personal-growth are core to everything we do.
        If that sounds exciting to be part of, and you feel you have the skills to help, we'd love for you to apply.

      %h2.text-h2.mb-12 Responsibilities
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        There are four main areas of responsibility:
      %ul.text-p-xlarge.mb-40
        %li
          This is a hands-on role where you'll spend at least half your time working directly with the community, welcoming new members, supporting existing maintainers and mentors, and helping people bridge the gap from Exercism-newbie to Exercism-contributor.
        %li
          Some of your time will be spent in designing and implementing systems to support the building and nurturing of our community.
          You'll work closely with our CEO, Head of Open Source, and our most trusted volunteers to explore how we can constantly be making Exercism more friendy, inclusive, and useful to everyone involved.
          You'll become the voice of the community in our core team, helping us understand their needs and desires, and helping scope the technical solutions we can build to support them better.
        %li
          You'll be one of the faces of Exercism.
          You'll take part in our weekly community calls, host interviews with contributors, and co-create non-technical content that inspires and supports the community.
        %li
          Finally, you'll also have input for the community aspects of other parts of Exercism, such as helping choose what products to put in Exercism's swag store, helping to determine how we can encourage community donations, and working out what non-Exercism initiatives we should support (e.g. #100daysofcode).

      %h2.text-h2.mb-12 Is this job right for you?
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        The right person for this role will be someone who is passionate about community, loves people, cares about free lifelong education (preferably programming or STEM), and who shares our values.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        The nature of our community means you'll be working with people from diverse backgrounds with a wide variety of opinions, personalities and communication styles.
        You'll find some people easy to chat to and others more challenging.
        If you're right for this role, you'll embrace that spectrum of personalities and be constantly curious about what makes people think and act as they do.
        You'll be excited to find ways to make Exercism welcoming to everyone and comfortable stepping into tough conversions and defusing tension.
        Culture will matter to you and you'll be driven to design and nurture a kind and supportive culture at Exercism.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        We passionately care about creating a diverse community and empowering people from under-represented groups.
        Its important you care about that too, are excited to make a difference in the social-makeup of the tech community, and to be willing to engage in hard conversations to make that a reality.
        We have a Code of Conduct, which we strictly enforce, and it's important that you're willing to stand up for its values.
        You'll never be alone in this role - our core team and most trusted volunteers will always be there to support you - but to thrive in this role, you will need be a leader who takes responsibility.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        Maybe you're someone who's been working in Community Management for a while and is looking for a new challenge.
        Maybe you've got a background in HR and want to work with community rather than employees.
        Maybe you've been a forum moderator, enjoyed that role, and want to turn it into a career.
        While your experience will help demonstrate your capability, we're agnostic to your background - what matters to us is whether we think you'll do a good job.
        There are no formal education requirements for this role but if you've studied community (either formally or as a hobby/interest) that will help us trust you even more.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        At Exercism, we have a shared commitment to kindness, honesty, and curiosity, and strive to build a working environment where everyone can learn, improve and do their best work.
        We believe that everyone has the right to feel happy, safe and supported at work, and strive to ensure that is the case at Exercism.
        We celebrate diversity, and do better work because of the different perspectives and insights that different experiences bring.
        It's important to us that you share these values and want to be part of a team living them out.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-40
        Finally, we want someone who can get passionate about Exercism.
        We are passionate about what we're building - about creating a world-class educational resource that everyone can use for free, which is centered around people, and it matters to us that everyone in the team shares that passion.
        You don't have to be a programmer yourself, but hopefully you'll be inspired to learn via Exercism once you start!
