        %strong Become Exercism's Content Factotum!
        We need someone to lead and support our team of content-creating volunteers as we create one of the best educational resources on the planet.
        Are you looking for a job that's a mixture of strategy, authoring, editing and leading?
        Do you have a passion for programming?
        If so, this role might be perfect for you!

      %h2.text-h2.mb-12 Summary
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        Exercism is a not-for-profit organisation providing world-class programming education to anyone for free.
        Our online platform is centred around self-directed learning and volunteer mentoring, and has nearly one million members.
        Over the next 5 years, we want to become the defacto programming education platform that anyone, anywhere can use for free.
        Through our work we aim to improve the global standard of programming and increase participation in tech from under-represented groups.
        You can learn more about Exercism in our #{link_to '"About Exercism" pages', 'https://exercism.org/about', target: '_blank', rel: :noopener}.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        At the heart of Exercism is our content - thousands of programming exercises across over 50 programming languages, designed to teach and enable practice of programming concepts, nearly all of which has been written by our volunteer community.
        As we continue to grow our content, and plan to expand it beyond our traditional exercise format, we need someone to lead our content strategy.
        This is a hands-on role, where you'll be writing and editing content, strategising and planning, and supporting our volunteer maintainers.
        Currently this role is split between the CEO and Head of Open Source, both of whom you'll work closely with.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-32
        We are building an exceptional team of ambitious, passionate people who love their work, excel at what they do, and have fun doing it.
        The values of empathy, integrity and personal-growth are core to everything we do.
        If that sounds exciting to be part of, and you feel you have the skills to help, we'd love for you to apply.

      %h2.text-h2.mb-12 Responsibilities
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        Your role splits roughly into three areas.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        The first is strategic, which has the following key responsibilities:
      %ul.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        %li Work with our CEO and Head of Open Source to more tightly define our our wider content strategy for the next three years.
        %li Work with our senior maintainers to design and document systems that improve the flow and quality of content.
        %li Work with our content partners (e.g. Packt Publishing) to determine synergies between their content and ours, and how we can make the most use of their educational portfolio.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        The second is a leadership role:
      %ul.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        %li You will be the senior content voice for our community, answering questions, arbitrating discussions, and acting as the knowledgable sage of wisdom. This doesn't mean you have to be the most knowledgable on any given subject, but means you must speak to Exercism's perspective on content, education, and how we make pragmatic decisions.
        %li Along with our Head of Open Source you will support tracks where there are no maintainers, addressing issues and reviewing pull-requests from contributors. In this you will also be supported by our community "reviewers" team, who help out in PR reviews on tracks where there are no formal maintainers.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        The third, but by no means least, is actually writing educational content.
        As part of our three year plan, we are extending our content beyond programming-language content, to the programming concept - looking at fundamental programming concepts, design patterns, and the knowledge that makes someone an excellent programmer.
        You will lead this, planning out and writing the content, supported by both our internal team and our contributor team.

      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-40
        Although that's a lot of different hats to wear, they are a synergistic set of responsibilities, which all center around the central mindset of "owning" Exercism's programming content.
        There will be a lot to learn, but we have a knowledgeable and friendly community who will support you in the role, and three core team members who have all worked in this role and have years of experience to share.
        We'll give you time to get up to speed and support you in every step of the way.

      %h2.text-h2.mb-12 Is this job right for you?
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        The right person for this role will be someone who loves programming, is passionate about education, and who shares our values.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        In this role you'll be working with a wealth of smart, opiniated volunteers, each with their own preferences and ideas.
        Discussing and exploring those ideas is a key piece of the role, and something it's important you'll enjoy.
        At Exercism, we place a high value on
        %strong pragmatism
        \- the ability to balance finding the best answer with the one that makes the path forward easiest.
        To succeed in this role it's important you value that pragmatism too and will enjoy digging into people's opinions, balancing them with your own, and finding pragmatic routes forward.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        You might be coming from a developer background wanting to use your knowledge in education, or maybe you're an educator and wanting to focus on programming education.
        Maybe programming has been a hobby for you and you want others to share in that same passion.
        We're entirely agnostic about your background, and don't require any specific academic qualifications.
        You don't need to be the best developer in the world, but you do need some solid programming fundamentals and need to be excited to learn and develop your knowledge.
        Our main criteria for hiring will be the belief that you will be able to execute in the role.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        At Exercism, we have a shared commitment to kindness, honesty, and curiosity, and strive to build a working environment where everyone can learn, improve and do their best work.
        We believe that everyone has the right to feel happy, safe and supported at work, and strive to ensure that is the case at Exercism.
        We celebrate diversity, and do better work because of the different perspectives and insights that different experiences bring.
        It's important to us that you share these values and want to be part of a team living them out.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-40
        Finally, we want someone who can get passionate about Exercism.
        We are passionate about what we're building - about creating a world-class educational resource that everyone can use for free, and it matters to us that everyone in the team shares that passion.
