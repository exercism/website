      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        Exercism is a not-for-profit organisation providing world-class programming education to anyone for free.
        Our online platform is centred around self-directed learning and volunteer mentoring, and has nearly one million members.
        Over the next 5 years, we want to become the defacto programming education platform that anyone, anywhere can use for free.
        Through our work we aim to improve the global standard of programming and increase participation in tech from under-represented groups.
        You can learn more about Exercism in our #{link_to '"About Exercism" pages', 'https://exercism.org/about', target: '_blank', rel: :noopener}.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        To take our next steps we need to grow our team.
        To do that we need to place ourselves on more solid financial ground.
        We're looking for someone to lead this process, to work with the CEO to create a comprehensive fundraising strategy, and to execute it, raising funds through sponsorship and partnerships.
        Our target is to generate Â£500k of funds in the next 12 months.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-32
        We are building an exceptional team of ambitious, passionate people who love their work, excel at what they do, and have fun doing it.
        The values of empathy, integrity and personal-growth are core to everything we do.
        If that sounds exciting to be part of, and you feel you have the skills to help, we'd love for you to apply.

      %h2.text-h2.mb-12 Responsibilities
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        So far, fundraising has been done on an ad-hoc basis by our CEO.
        Over the last 3 years, we have raised ~Â£800k in support from organisations including #{link_to 'Mozilla', 'https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/', target: '_blank', rel: :noopener}, #{link_to 'Packt Publishing', 'https://www.packtpub.com/about', target: '_blank', rel: :noopener}, #{link_to 'GoBridge', 'https://exercism.org/partners/gobridge', target: '_blank', rel: :noopener}, and the #{link_to 'University of Chicago', 'https://www.uchicago.edu/', target: '_blank', rel: :noopener}, ~Â£500k of which has come since Dec 2021.
        Your role is to take that ad-hoc work, formalise it into a coherent strategy, and then execute on that to deliver Â£500k of new support in the next 12 months.
        If the initial work is successful, we will reinvest some of the funds into growing a fundraising team around you.
        Although most of your role will be autonomous, you will have close access to the CEO to strategise and explore opportunities as needed.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        The key areas of your work will be:

      %ul.text-p-xlarge.mb-40
        %li Work with the CEO to develop an overarching fundraising strategy.
        %li Identify, approach, and close deals with potential sponsors.
        %li Identify partnership opportunities and work with the CEO to close them.
        %li Identify and apply for grants.

      %h2.text-h2.mb-12 Is this job right for you?
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        The right person for this role will be someone with the experience to devise and execute a fundraising strategy, who cares about free lifelong education (preferably programming or STEM), and who shares our values.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        Maybe you're relatively early in your career, looking to take a step up into a position of more responsibility?
        Maybe you're coming towards the end of your career and looking to give back to a not-for-profit?
        Or maybe you're somewhere in between?
        All are fine by us.
        Similarly, we don't require any specific academic qualifications.
        Our main criteria for hiring will be the belief that you will be able to execute in the role.
        For that, we need to see some track-record of fundraising and/or sales and your ability to think and plan strategically.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        At Exercism, we have a shared commitment to kindness, honesty, and curiosity, and strive to build a working environment where everyone can learn, improve and do their best work.
        We believe that everyone has the right to feel happy, safe and supported at work, and strive to ensure that is the case at Exercism.
        We celebrate diversity, and do better work because of the different perspectives and insights that different experiences bring.
        It's important to us that you share these values and want to be part of a team living them out.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-40
        Finally, we want someone who can get passionate about Exercism.
        We are passionate about what we're building - about creating a world-class educational resource that everyone can use for free, and it matters to us that everyone in the team shares that passion.
        You don't have to be a programmer yourself, but hopefully you'll be inspired to learn via Exercism once you start!
