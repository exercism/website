            %strong As you're not logged into your Exercism account, we need to manually connect things for you.
            Firstly, please make sure you have an Exercism account. If you don't, #{link_to 'create one here', 'https://exercism.org/users/sign_up', class: 'text-primary-blue font-semibold'}.

            If the email address on that account is #{@bootcamp_data.email}, you should now have access.
            If it's not, please email us at
            %strong.font-medium bootcamp@exercism.org
            with your Exercism username/handle and the email address you've enrolled with (#{@bootcamp_data.email}) and we'll give you access manually.
