        %h3
          Hi there!
          %span.waving-hand
            üëã
          I'm Jeremy, and I've helped over
          .inline.rough-highlight two million people
          level up their coding skills.
        %p
          But over the last few years, I've seen a really worrying trend...
        %p
          More and more people are trying to learn to code (ü•≥) but they seem to be
          %strong struggling more than ever (üò¢).
          And they're struggling with things that should be pretty straightforward once you've been learning for a while.
          People just don't seem to be getting the fundamentals.

        %p So I started reading around to see if I could work out what was going on, and found a crazy statistic.
        %h3
          %span.inline.rough-highlight 96% of people who try to learn to code give up
          ü§Ø

        %p How could it be that so many people were trying to learn to code, but so few were actually succeeding?
        %p I went investigating‚Ä¶ üïµÔ∏è
        %p
          I watched the
          %strong most popular YouTube videos (ü•±),
          tried the "best"
          %strong online courses (üòê),
          and even paid my friends to try to learn so I could see what happened (a mix of üò≠üò†ü§¨üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).

        %p I dug into formal research, spoke to my friends in education, and pretty quickly came to a simple conclusion...

        %h3
          %span.inline.rough-highlight The way people are being taught to code is causing them to fail!
        %p
          I started coding when I was 8.
          Back then, YouTube didn't exist. There weren't any "learn to code" websites. I didn't even have the internet.
          There was basically only one way to learn.
          %strong Make stuff. Lots of stuff!

        .sm:float-right.mt-20.sm:ml-24.sm:mb-24{class: "xl:mr-[-100px] mr-0"}
          %div{class: 'border-white border-[8px] rounded-[5px] lg:w-[300px] sm:w-[220px] w-full', style: "box-shadow: 0 0 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5);"}

              %span.lg:inline.hidden 1998: Me and Rhodri making the first website we ever got paid for.

        %p.mt-16
          And make stuff I did! I started making games and then graduated to making little bots to play against. And as I grew older I made websites for me and my friends, and
          %span.sm:hidden.inline eventually for customers.
          %span.sm:inline.hidden.relative
            %span#eventually-underline.rough-underline.whitespace-nowrap
              eventually for customers.
            %span#rhodri.arrow-animation

        %p I created, I played, I experimented. I had fun!
        %p
          And through this, I got really good.
          %strong I learned the coder mindset,
          and I laid the foundations that I've built my whole career on.
        %p
          %strong.rough-highlight But that's not how these modern courses teach.
          Giving you a space to practice and play and experiment is hard.
          It's much easier to just give you a video to watch, a quiz to take, and a certificate to print out.
        %p
          But you won't learn that way.
          You'll be
          %strong bored, frustrated,
          and like most other people, you'll
          %strong probably quit üòûüò°

        %h3
          %span.rough-highlight If you want to get good, master the basics

        %p
          The best coders
          %strong are not
          the ones who know the most.
        %p
          The best coders are the ones who have
          %strong.rough-highlight gained a total mastery of the basics.
          Once you've got the basics down, everything will become easy.
          You can go and learn whatever you want or need.
        %p
          And the way to master the basics? Practice, practice, practice.
        %p
          Take on different challenges. Solve different problems. And have fun learning your craft!
        %h3
          %span.rough-highlight So that's what we're doing...

        %p
          For the last year, we've been building a new type of course.
          It's designed for
          %strong total beginners
          and it's entirely focused on
          %strong learning by doing.
          You'll be coding from day one, and
          %strong.font-semibold.rough-highlight you'll be coding a lot.
        %p
          And once (just once!) we're going to run it as an
          %strong interactive bootcamp,
          where
          %strong I'll be there to guide you.
          I'll be there to explore ideas with you, help you if you get stuck, and have fun with you! ‚ú®
        %p
          For 3 months, I'll teach you the fundamentals of programming and
          %strong how to think like a coder.
          Then for those who want to go into web development, I'll spend another 3 months teaching you how to build beautiful, interactive websites.
        %p
          If that sounds exciting, then
          %strong I'd love for you to join us! üíô

        .faq
          %h4 Can I join Part 1 now and then sign up for the rest of the course later?
          %p Yes, you can. But it will be more expensive to sign up for Part 2 later than it is to sign up for the full course now. We recommend signing up for the full course now if you're confident you want to learn web development.
        .faq
          %h4 Are there group activities and do I have to take part?
          %p
            There are no formal group activities.
            However, we encourage everyone to share their journey and explore programming together in our Discord server.
            Exploring other people's code is one of the best ways to improve your programming skills.
            You can choose to opt-out of the community aspects if you prefer.
        .faq
          %h4 What specific programming language will be taught in Part 1?
          %p
            We'll be teaching you a special beginner-friendly version of JavaScript
            We've designed it specifically to ensure you don't get bogged down by syntax or language oddities.
            The focus is on your learning how to code and then being able to apply that to any language, but you'll also get a big head start on JavaScript preparing you for Part 2.
        .faq
          %h4 Is there a limit to the number of students who can join the live sessions?
          %p No, the sessions will be streamed online and everyone will be able to ask questions and participate. You can watch them back at any time in the future.
        .faq
          %h4 Are the exercises graded or just for practice? Is there any form of assessment?
          %p Most exercises can be completed by reaching a certain objective. However, they are not graded and your code isn't assessed or marked. We will explore some (anonymised) code in the weekly sessions and discuss how it could be improved, but our philosophy is that you should be in the trenches coding, not worrying about passing tests.
        .faq
          %h4 Will I be job-ready by the end of the bootcamp?
          %p A few exceptional students might be in a position where they're confident applying for junior jobs. But for most people, we'll recommend spending a few more months honing your skills before entering your first programming job. Job hunting can be tough, and the more refined your skills, the more likely you'll be to get that first job!
        - if @has_discount
          .faq
            %h4 How does the discount for #{@country_name} work?
            %p We understand that $#{@full_complete_price} is a significant amount of money in countries with currencies that are weak against the dollar. So we're offering a #{@discount_percentage}% discount to people in #{@country_name} to ensure they can take part.
