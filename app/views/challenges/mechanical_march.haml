            Month 4 of #12in23
          %h1.text-h1.mb-8 It's Mechanical March! ✨
          %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-20
            This month for #12in23 we're exploring system languages - those that compile to machine code. We've got interviews with core language and community members (from Go, Rust and hopefully more!), lots of live streaming, exclusive swag and more.

              %p.text-p-base.mb-8
                Our introductory video gives a quick overview to the month, explores what we mean by systems languages, looks at where they're useful, and finally gives a quick comparison between the featured languages this month.

          %p.text-p-large.mb-20
            Earn the Mechanical March badge for completing and publishing 5 exercises in one of the following languages.
            Consider starting with a language with a syllabus (
            = graphical_icon "concepts", css_class: 'w-[14px] h-[14px] filter-purple inline mx-[-4px]'
            ).

          - tracks = Track.where(slug: %w[c cpp d go nim rust vlang zig])
          .grid.grid-cols-8.gap-12.mb-32
            - tracks.each do |track|
              = link_to track, class: 'rounded-12 shadow-base hover:shadow-baseZ1 bg-white flex flex-col p-12 text-center relative' do
                - if track.course?
                  .rounded-circle.bg-white.p-4.shadow-baseZ1{ class: 'absolute top-[-7px] right-[-7px]' }
                    = graphical_icon "concepts", css_class: 'w-[14px] h-[14px] filter-purple'
                = image_tag track.icon_url, class: 'mb-8'
                .text-h6= track.title

          %p.text-p-large.mb-12
            You can solve any exercises in these tracks to get the badge, but we recommend the following as interesting challenges to approach in systems languages:

              %strong.font-semibold Sieve:

              A classic exercise for loops.

            Throughout the month we'll have interviews — including Josh Triplett, the co-lead of Rust, and Jonny Boursiquot, a key member of the Go community — walkthroughs from Exercism track contributors, and live streams of the community solving exercises. We're hoping to give some regular streamers official residencies this month too!
