          %h1.text-h1.mb-8 It's Mechanical March! ‚ú®
          %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-20
            This month for #12in23 we're exploring system languages - those that compile to machine code. We've got interviews with core language and community members (from Go, Rust and hopefully more!), lots of live streaming, exclusive swag and more.

                Our introductory video gives a quick overview to the month, explores what we mean by systems languages, looks at where they're useful, and finally gives a quick comparison between the featured languages this month.

          %p.text-p-large.mb-20
            Earn the Mechanical March badge for completing and publishing 5 exercises in one of the following languages.
            Consider starting with a language with a syllabus (
            = graphical_icon "concepts", css_class: 'w-[14px] h-[14px] filter-purple inline mx-[-4px]'
            ).

          %p.text-p-large.mb-12
            You can solve any exercises in these tracks to get the badge, but we recommend the following as interesting challenges to approach in systems languages:
