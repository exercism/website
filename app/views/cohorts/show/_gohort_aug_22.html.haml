      %p.text-p-2xlarge What happens when a few committed learners encourage and help each other on their learning journeys? We've invented the Gohort to find out! (The "Go cohort", see what we did there? ðŸ˜‰)

          The Go track on Exercism has
          %em #{user_track.num_concepts} concepts
          to learn, along with
          %em #{user_track.num_exercises} coding exercises
          for you to complete. Itâ€™s a great way to pick up Go specific concepts and ways of working.

        %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-32.text-center

            And better still, get mentoring from senior Go developers to discover your knowledge gaps and build a deep understanding of the language.
