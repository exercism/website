    %h3
      Hi there!
      %span.waving-hand
        üëã
      I'm Jeremy, and I've helped over
      .inline.rough-highlight two million people
      level up their coding skills.
    %p
      But over the last few years, I've seen a really worrying trend...
    %p
      More and more people are trying to learn to code (ü•≥) but they seem to be
      %strong struggling more than ever (üò¢).
      And they're struggling with things that should be pretty straightforward once you've been learning for a while.
      %strong People just don't seem to be grasping the fundamentals.

    %p So I started reading around to see if I could work out what was going on, and found a crazy statistic.
    %h3
      %span.inline.rough-highlight 96% of people who try to learn to code give up
      ü§Ø

    %p How could it be that so many people were trying to learn to code, but so few were actually succeeding?
    %p I went investigating‚Ä¶ üïµÔ∏è
    %p
      I watched the
      %strong most popular YouTube videos (ü•±),
      tried the "best"
      %strong online courses (üòê),
      and even paid my friends to try to learn so I could see what happened (a mix of üò≠üò†ü§¨üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).

    %p I dug into formal research, spoke to my friends in education, and pretty quickly came to a simple conclusion...

    %h3
      %span.inline.rough-highlight The way people are being taught to code is causing them to fail!
    %p
      I started coding when I was 8.
      Back then, YouTube didn't exist. There weren't any "learn to code" websites. I didn't even have the internet.
      There was basically only one way to learn.
      %strong Make stuff. Lots of stuff!

    %p.mt-16
      And make stuff I did! I started making games and then graduated to making little bots to play against. And as I grew older I made websites for me and my friends, and
      %span.sm:hidden.inline eventually for customers.

        %span#eventually-underline.rough-underline.whitespace-nowrap
          eventually for customers.
        %span#rhodri.arrow-animation

    %p I created, I played, I experimented. I had fun!
    %p
      And through this, I got really good.
      %strong I learned the coder mindset,
      and I laid the foundations that I've built my whole career on.
    %p
      %strong.rough-highlight But that's not how these modern courses teach.
      Giving you a space to practice and play and experiment is hard.
      It's much easier to just give you a video to watch, a quiz to take, and a certificate to print out.
    %p
      But you won't learn that way.
      You'll be
      %strong bored, frustrated,
      and like most other people, you'll
      %strong probably quit üòûüò°

    %p

      the ones who know the most.
    %p
      The best coders are the ones who have
      %strong.rough-highlight gained a total mastery of the basics.
      Once you've got the basics down, everything will become easy.
      You can go and learn whatever you want or need.
    %p
      And the way to master the basics? Practice, practice, practice.
    %p
      Take on different challenges. Solve different problems. And have fun learning your craft!
    %h3
      %span.rough-highlight Which is why we made this...

    %p
      We've made a different type of course. One that teaches you the fundamentals of coding differently. It's focused on getting you
      %strong building fun things,
      on solving interesting problems, on learning the coding mindset that will actually get you good at this.
    %p
      Within 12 weeks, you'll go from zero to building games like
      %strong Space Invaders, Tic Tac Toe, and
      %strong Breakout.
      You'll be building bots that can solve mazes, and talking to real APIs like

      We have a great community of alumni and mentors who are there to help you when you get stuck.
      And I'll be there too, making sure you get the most out of the course!
    %p
      We've designed the course for

      %strong learning by doing.
      You'll be coding from day one, and

      It's also perfect if you've

      but you don't feel like you've got a solid grasp on everything yet. About 50% of our students are in that category and love the course.

    %h2 Frequently Asked Questions
    %p.intro
      These are the questions we get asked the most. Your question not answered here?
      = link_to "Ping us an email!", "mailto:bootcamp@exercism.org"

    .faq
      %h4 When will I get access and how long for?
      %p You gain access to the full Coding Fundamentals course as soon as your pay. You'll have access for life.
      %p The Front-End Fundamentals course will run live from April 26th till mid-July. You'll also have access to the course materials beyond that date for life.

    .faq
      %h4 How much time will I need to spend each week on the course?
      %p You can spend as long or as little as you like. In general, people who spend an 1-2 hours per day on the course get through each Level in 1-2 weeks.

    .faq
      %h4 How hard is the course? How smart do I need to be?
      %p The course is designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of your background. We don't believe you need to be "smart" to learn to code. But you do need to put in the effort and be willing to be challenged.
      %p But if you put in the effort, ask for help when you get stuck, and embrace the challenge, you'll be amazed at how far you can go in a short time.

    .faq
      %h4 Are there group activities and do I have to take part?
      %p
        There are no formal group activities.
        However, we encourage everyone to share their journey and explore programming together in our Discord server.
        Chatting about code is one of the best ways to improve your programming skills.
        Many of our students get together (virtually) for unofficial study groups - so you might like to join some of them!
        You can choose to opt-out of the community aspects if you prefer.

    .faq
      %h4 What specific programming language is taught.
      %p
        We're teaching you a special beginner-friendly language called JikiScript.
        It's a full, normal programming language, but it's been designed specifically to ensure you don't get bogged down by syntax or language oddities.
      %p
        Once you've learnt JikiScript and understand the core programming concepts, you'll find it straight-forward to learn Python, JavaScript, or any other language using Exercism's free courses.

    .faq
      %h4 Are the exercises graded or just for practice? Is there any form of assessment?
      %p Most exercises can be completed by reaching a certain objective. However, they are not graded and your code isn't assessed or marked. We will explore some (anonymised) code in the weekly sessions and discuss how it could be improved, but our philosophy is that you should be in the trenches coding, not worrying about passing tests.

    .faq
      %h4 I've signed up but not received anything.
      %p Firstly, please check your spam. If you still can't find anything, please email #{link_to 'bootcamp@exercism.org', 'mailto:bootcamp@exercism.org', class: 'font-semibold text-[blue]'} and we'll check everything for you!
