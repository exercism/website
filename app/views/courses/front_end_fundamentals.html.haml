      When I first wrote my first lines of JavaScript over 25 years ago, almost no-one knew how to code.
      If you could make even the simplest of websites, you were a wizard! üßô
    %p
      But now-a-days, web development is a very
      %strong competitive market.
      Standing out from the crowd is much tougher.
    %p
      Lots of people think you stand out by knowing the
      %strong most languages or the most frameworks.
      But that's not true!
      When I'm hiring, I look for one thing...

    %h3
      %span.inline.rough-highlight Do you have the coding mindset?  üß†

    %p
      The people that thrive at coding, the ones that get the best jobs and enjoy the work the most share one thing.
      They have the
      %strong coder mindset.
      They are great at
      %strong critical thinking,
      great at
      %strong problem solving.
    %p
      To become a good developer you need to learn how to think like a coder.
      And the secret to that is to
      %strong practice making real things,
      with the right
      %strong guidance, support and mentoring.

    %h3
      %span.inline.rough-highlight What is this course?
    %p
      This is a new type of course, that teaches you the fundamentals of web development - things like CSS and JavaScript - but does it differently, focussed on getting you
      %strong building fun things.
      In the first few weeks, you'll be building games like
      %strong Space Invaders, Tic Tac Toe, and
      %strong Breakout.
      You'll be building bots that can solve mazes, and talking to real APIs like
      %strong ChatGPT
      to build useful real-world projects.

      And once (just once!) we're going to run the course as an
      %strong interactive bootcamp,
      where
      %strong I'll be there to guide you.
      I'll be there to explore ideas with you, help you if you get stuck, and have fun with you! ‚ú®
    %p
      For 3 months, I'll teach you the fundamentals of web development, and help you
      %strong to think like a coder.
    %p
      And even more, we have world-class mentors to help you out.
      Some who have worked in web-dev for decades and others who have worked at places like Google.
      They'll be there to help nudge you in the right directions and challenge you even more!
    %p

    %h2 Frequently Asked Questions
    %p.intro
      These are the questions we get asked the most. Your question not answered here?
      = link_to "Ping us an email!", "mailto:bootcamp@exercism.org"

    .faq
      %h4 When does the Bootcamp start?
      %p
        The first session of Front-End Fundamentals be on April 26th 2025.
        If you buy the bundle with Coding Fundamentals, you can access all that content immediately!
    .faq
      %h4 How much time will I need to spend each week on the bootcamp?
      %p We're aiming for about 8 hours per week (See the "What your week will look like" for more details). If you can put in an hour per day, that will be enough for you to get through the main work. If you can invest an extra few hours per week, you'll be able to also complete any more advanced exercises.
    .faq
      %h4 I missed the first part of the Bootcamp? Can I do join now?
      %p The first part of the Bootcamp is now called "Coding Fundamentals" and is available for you to buy as part of the bundle above.
    .faq
      %h4 Are there group activities and do I have to take part?
      %p
        There are no formal group activities.
        However, we encourage everyone to share their journey and explore programming together in our Discord server.
        Exploring other people's code is one of the best ways to improve your programming skills.
        Some students get together (virtually) for study sessions.
        You can choose to opt-out of the community aspects if you prefer.
    .faq
      %h4 What specific programming languages/techniques will be taught in Front-End Fundamentals?
      %p
        We'll be teaching JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
        We'll be teaching modern JavaScript. We'll teach both a functional approach and also Object Oriented Programming, so you'll get a mixture of the things you see in the wild!
    .faq
      %h4 Is there a limit to the number of students who can join the live sessions?
      %p No, the sessions will be streamed online and everyone will be able to ask questions and participate. You can watch them back at any time in the future.
    .faq
      %h4 Are the exercises graded or just for practice? Is there any form of assessment?
      %p Most exercises can be completed by reaching a certain objective. However, they are not graded and your code isn't assessed or marked. We will explore some (anonymised) code in the weekly sessions and discuss how it could be improved, but our philosophy is that you should be in the trenches coding, not worrying about passing tests.
    - if @has_discount
      .faq
        %h4 How does the discount for #{@country_name} work?
        %p We understand that $#{@full_price} is a significant amount of money in countries with currencies that are weak against the dollar. So we're offering a #{@discount_percentage}% discount to people in #{@country_name} to ensure they can take part.
        %p Simply click the "Enroll now" button and the discount will be automatically applied at checkout.

    .faq
      %h4 I've signed up but not received anything.

If you don't receive those, please email #{link_to 'bootcamp@exercism.org', 'mailto:bootcamp@exercism.org', class: 'font-semibold text-[blue]'} and we'll check everything for you.
