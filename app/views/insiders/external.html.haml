          %summary What are the exact criteria for Insiders access?
          %p.mb-12
            You can check the exact algorithm #{link_to 'in our codebase', 'https://github.com/exercism/website/tree/main/app/commands/user/insiders_status/determine_eligibility_status.rb'} but it's also reproduced here.
          %p.mb-4 To gain lifetime access you need one of the following:
          %ul.mb-16
            %li To be a founder or staff member
            %li To be a supermentor (100+ solutions mentored on a track with a 95% positive rating)
            %li To have a reputation equal or greater than 1,000
            %li To have donated $499 (in one or many parts)

          %p.mb-4 For those without lifetime access, to gain access you need one of the following:
          %ul.mb-16
            %li To be a maintainer
            %li To have had a recurring donation at the point that Premium launched (May 30th 2023), and it still to be active.
            %li To have earned 30 reputation in the last 30 days, or 200 reputation in the last 365 days (not including reputation for publishing solutions)

          %p.mb-4 You can also gain access to Insiders by donating.
          %ul.mb-16
            %li For donations before we launched Premium, you get one month of Insiders for every $9.99 donated, from the date that Premium launched, plus one extra bonus month. So if you donated $35 before Premium launched, you'd get Insiders access through June, July, August and September 2023.
            %li For donations after we launched Premium, you get one month of Insiders for every $25 donated. So if you donate $50 today, you'll have access for the next two months.

          Sometimes the tech breaks down and we don't get webhook notifications from GitHub or Paypal.

          %summary What does Insiders cost?
          Insiders isn't a product that you can buy - it's a rewards program for those who contribute, mentor or donate.
          If you'd like access, you can start contributing, mentoring, or donate $499 or more to Exercism.

          %summary How do I earn reputation?
          Reputation is earned by mentoring or contributing to Exercism.
          You can also earn reputation by publishing your solutions, but that does not count towards Insiders access.
          You can check what actions result in what reputation by consulting #{link_to 'our docs', 'https://exercism.org/docs/using/product/reputation#h-acquisition-of-reputation'}.
          Check your #{link_to 'journey page', journey_path} to see where you're earning reputation.
