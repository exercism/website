%p Hi #{@user&.handle || "there"},
%p Thank you so much for choosing Coding Fundamentals! We're so excited to have you on board!

    Your Exercism account has been granted access to the course.
    You can access it here: #{link_to "https://exercism.org/bootcamp/dashboard", bootcamp_dashboard_url} (you might want to bookmark this link!)

    %strong As you were not logged into your Exercism account when purchasing the course, we need to connect things up for you.
    The easiest way is to #{link_to 'create an exercism account', 'https://exercism.org/users/sign_up', class: 'text-primary-blue font-semibold'} with the email address #{@enrollment.email}. That will automatically give you access.
  %p
    If you create your account with a different email address, please reply to this email with your Exercism username/handle and the email address you've enrolled with (#{@enrollment.email}) and we'll give you access manually.

%p We'd love you to join our #{link_to "Discord server", "https://exercism.org/r/discord"} and say hello. Becoming part of the community is a great way to keep motivated when things feel tough! Connect your Exercism and Discord accounts #{link_to "here", "https://exercism.org/settings/integrations"} and then you should be able to see the #bootcamp channel. Any problems, just post in the public #bootcamp-onboarding channel and someone will help you out!

%p 
  Finally, it would be great to connect and I'd love to hear about your goals with coding, and why you chose the course. 
  %strong Please reply to this email and say hello! ðŸ™‚
%p Thank you again!
