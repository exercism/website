%p Hi #{@user.handle},
%p Thank you so much for choosing Front-end Fundamentals! We're really excited to have you on board!
%p The first session is planned for April 19th. Until then, you can join our #{link_to "Discord server", "https://exercism.org/r/discord"} and say hello. Connect your Exercism and Discord accounts #{link_to "here", "https://exercism.org/settings/integrations"} and then you should be able to see #bootcamp. Any problems, just post in the public #bootcamp-onboarding channel and someone will help you out!
%p Thank you again!
