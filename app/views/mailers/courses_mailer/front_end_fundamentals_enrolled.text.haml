Hi #{@user&.handle || "there"},
\
Thank you so much for choosing Front-End Fundamentals! We're really excited to have you on board!
\
The first session is planned for April 19th. Until then, you can join our #{link_to "Discord server", "https://exercism.org/r/discord"} and say hello. Connect your Exercism and Discord accounts #{link_to "here", "https://exercism.org/settings/integrations"} and then you should be able to see #bootcamp. Any problems, just post in the public #bootcamp-onboarding channel and someone will help you out!
\
It would be great to connect and I'd love to hear about your goals with coding, and why you chose the course. Please reply to this email and say hello! ðŸ™‚

Thank you again!
