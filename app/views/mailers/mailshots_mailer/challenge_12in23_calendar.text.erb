We've now finalised the calendar for the year. Each month is going to have a different theme, with interviews from langauge experts (and even language creators!), live streaming of walkthroughs and solving exercises, themed swag, and all sorts of goodies. I've put together a video talking through the different themes - have a watch and let us know which you're most excited for!

The first theme is Functional February, and we're still planning how to make it as fun and useful as possible. Please let us know your thoughts in the forum. All ideas are welcome - the wackier the better!

Have a great day!
