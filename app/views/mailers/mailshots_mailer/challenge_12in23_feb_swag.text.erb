Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

We're getting close to the end of Functional February. now, but we've still got a few things to share! Firstly, we've now launched our Functional Febrary swag. We've put together t-shirts and hoodies in a couple of designs celebrating functional programming. They'll be available for the next few weeks only! Get them in the SWAG Store.

Erik's also been releasing a few more videos in his "A Brief Introduction to..." series. We have F#, Elixir and Haskell launched, and others including Gleam and Scala coming in the next couple of days. They're a useful, concise introduction to programming languages, explaining why you'd want to use them and demonstrating their usage through solving an Exercism exercise. Check them out on YouTube.
