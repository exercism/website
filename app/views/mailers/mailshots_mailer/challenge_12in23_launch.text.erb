Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

Happy new year! For 2023, weâ€™ve decided to do something a bit different. We're encouraging everyone to try 12 different languages throughout the year! We're calling this the #12in23 Challenge: https://exercism.org/challenges/12in23

Exploring different languages is a great way of opening your eyes to new concepts and paradigms and broadening your programming horizons. Weâ€™ve got over 60 languages ranging from the old (looking at you, Cobol) to the new and shiny (hello, Unison!) to the esoteric (everyoneâ€™s favourite: Prolog). Weâ€™ve got functional languages, OOPs languages, more lisps than you can shake a fist at, and some downride odd stuff like vimscript! Thereâ€™s loads to choose from ðŸ™‚

Each month from February weâ€™ll be showcasing a different category or theme and some of the languages that shine in that area.

And finally we want this to be social. You can use the #12in23 tag in the forum (https://forum.exercism.org/tag/12in23) to discuss the new things youâ€™re trying, or as a hashtag on social media or streaming platforms to showcase your solutions. If you are streaming or want to increase the reach of your videos, please again ping @jonathanmiddleton who can help!

I really hope you like the idea and are up for taking part!

Jeremy Walker,
CEO of Exercism
