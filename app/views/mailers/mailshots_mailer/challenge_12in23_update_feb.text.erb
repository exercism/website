Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

I hope you're enjoying #12in23 and Functional February. Thousands of people have been taking part and having loads of fun. I hope you've found it a useful and entertaining month so far!

Tomorrow (Tues 21st) at 18:30 UTC, I'm going to be chatting to Louis Pilfold, the creator of Gleam, exploring Gleam, functional programming, and asking him your questions! You can watch and join in on YouTube or Twitch.

In the meantime, you might like to watch this short update I just released, chatting about how #12in23 came to be, our plan for the year, news on a new badge (everyone loves a badge!) and more:
