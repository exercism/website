Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

It's been a year since we launched the new version of Exercism, and what an exciting year it's been! We've now helped over 1M people improve their coding skills, mentored over 300,000 people and gratefully received over $30,000 in donations. In the last few weeks, we've also launched new big features that we're really excited by!

ðŸ’¬ The new Exercism Forum

Our new forum is the place to share your programming journey with others, pick their brains when you get stuck, discussion new languages or concepts you discover, and to hang out with other similar-minded people. Come and say hello!

Check the forum at https://forum.exercism.org

ðŸ’¡ Dig Deeper tabs

Solving an exercise on Exercism is just the start. The real magic comes afterwards - working with mentors, exploring others solutions, and now with our new Dig Deeper tab, exploring the different approaches and tradeoffs that people take when solving that exercise.

ðŸ¤– Deeper Automated Feedback

Earlier this month we launched our biggest step in automation so far. Our new Representation system means that mentors' feedback will now be automatically given to people who submit similar solutions in the future. You should now see more accurate automated feedback more frequently across a wider range of exercises.
