Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

Here at Exercism, it's Functional February - a month dedicated to functional programming languages.

We've put together a really fun month for you, with interviews with language creators (including Jose Valim and Louis Pilfold), tons of live streaming, lots of fun exercise for you to complete, and a whole load of community action going on.

You can find all the details on the #12in23 Challenge page (sign up if you've not already - it's entirely free!): https://exercism.org/challenges/12in23

Or watch our Intro to Functional February video, which introduces the month and gives a nice overview of some key functional programming concepts - topics like immutability, pattern matching, recursion, first-class pure functions and more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFGx1SDnWI

We'll be exploring topics like immutability, pattern matching, recursion, first-class pure functions and more. If you've never tried functional languages before, they're a really eye-opening fun approach to coding. And if you're a functional pro, there's loads to challenge and inspire you here too!

Have a great day!
