Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

Welcome to Mechanical March, a month dedicated to languages that compile to machine code such as C, C++, D, Go, Nim, Rust, V and Zig!

We're aiming to build on the success of Functional February with more interviews, more live streaming, more swag and more great content. I'm delighted to announce that we've already lined up some amazing guests, including Josh Trippett, co-lead of Rust, and Johnny Boursiquot, a leading figure in Go. There's loads of community action going on on the forums and social media, and as always, it's all free!

Visit our #12in23 Challenge page for more details, or watch our Intro to Mechanical March video, in which Erik and I introduce the month, discuss what makes machine code interesting, and give a brief overview and comparison of the featured languages.

There's loads to challenge and inspire you this month, regardless of your level of experience. If you've not worked with low-level languages before, you'll find it fascinating and empowering to explore concepts like manual memory management. If you're more seasoned with systems languages, check out the cutting edge compiler in Rust, or the simplicity in Go.

Whatever you choose to explore, have fun!
