Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

Our interview and Ask me Anything (AMA) with José Valim, the creator of Elixir, is starting now! We'll be exploring Elixir - its past, present and future - and functional programming. At the end I'll be putting your questions to José! It's totally free. You can watch it on YouTube or Twitch:

I hope you enjoy the session!
