Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

Our interview and Ask me Anything (AMA) with Louis Pilfold, the creator of Gleam, is starting now! We'll be exploring Gleam - why he created it, the decision's he made, bulding a language community, and the future of the language. At the end I'll be putting your questions to Louis! It's totally free:

I hope you enjoy the session!
