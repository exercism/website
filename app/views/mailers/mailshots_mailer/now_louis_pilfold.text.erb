Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

Yesterday, I had a great chat with Louis Pilfold, the creator of Gleam! We covered loads of ground, exploring why Louis created Gleam (did the world really need another programming language?), his philosophy in creating the language, his experience in bulding a language community, and the future of the language as it approaches its 1.0 release. It was a really insightful interview.
If you joined us for the session, thanks for coming along! If you missed it, you can watch it back on our YouTube channel.
