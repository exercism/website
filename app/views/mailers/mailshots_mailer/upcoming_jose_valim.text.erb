Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

This week as part of Functional February we've got a really exciting interview planned with JosÃ© Valim, the creator of Elixir. It's on Thursday (Feb 9th) at 16:30 UTC and you can watch it on YouTube or Twitch.
- YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LknqlTouTKg
- Twitch: https://twitch.tv/exercismlive

We're going to be exploring why JosÃ© decided to make Elixir a functional language and how that's impacted it's evolution and growth. The second half of session will be an AMA ("ask me anything"), so you have the opportunity to ask JosÃ© questions. Simply join the YouTube or Twitch streams and ask a question in the chat.

We've also got live streams happening throughout the month and another featured interview with Louis Pilfold, the creator of Gleam, soon too. So keep an eye on the #12in23 page for more details. Everything is free and just for a good cause! ðŸ™‚

Have a great day!
