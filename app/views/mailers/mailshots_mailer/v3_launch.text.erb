Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

Two years ago we set out to fix the major problems with Exercism, especially the frustrations of losing momentum waiting for mentors. Solving this was a complex endeavour, and involved rethinking the whole flow of using the platform, redesigning our mentoring paradigm, and creating a whole new set of content to teach language concepts, not just to practice them.

Last month we finally launched the new platform, rewritten from the ground up, with new Learning Mode, a totally redesigned mentoring experience, an online editor, and much more. Since launch, our average mentor wait-time has dropped from a few days to three hours, and in many tracks is now under an hour!

We've also added a wealth of new features - including a reputation system, new profiles to showcase your work, and lots more automation. The whole site also got a beautiful makeover at the same time, and we switched to a new home at exercism.org.

Come and have a look and see what you think. We have 55 languages to explore, thousands of exercises, and hundreds of mentors waiting to help you. I hope you'll find Exercism fun and useful as you develop your programming skills!

Kind regards,

Jeremy Walker, 
CEO of Exercism
