%p Hi #{@user.handle},

%p This is a friendly reminder that your student (#{@discussion.student.handle}) has been waiting #{@num_days_waiting} days for you to reply in #{link_to 'the discussion', track_exercise_mentor_discussion_url(@track, @exercise, @discussion)} on their solution to #{@exercise.title} on the #{@track.title} track.

%p If it's not your turn and you're waiting on the student, please use the "It's the student's turnâ€¦" button in the mentoring UI.

%p The discussion will time out in #{@num_days_to_time_out} days if you do not reply.
