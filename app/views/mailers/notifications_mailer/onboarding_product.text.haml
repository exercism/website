Hey there,
\
It's been a day or so since you signed up to Exercism, and I wanted to check how you're getting on so far?
\
Sometimes Exercism can be a bit overwhelming at first. Some people get a bit lost and things don't quite make sense to them.
If you get stuck, check out our Discord (https://exercism.org/r/discord) or Forum (https://exercism.org/r/forum), where you can ask for help.
It's always helpful for us to know where people are tripping up so we can fix it, so please don't be afraid to speak up!
\
If you've not started exploring a language yet, we have over 65 to choose from, including the most widly used languages (e.g. Python, JavaScript, C#), the popular new-kids on the block (e.g. Go, Elixir, Rust) and some quite unusual and esotoric languages (e.g. 8th, COBOL, Prolog).
There's tons to learn and a lot of fun to be had!
\
And as a final a reminder, Exercism is 100% free, open-source and not for profit. Enjoy!
\
Best regards,
\
Jeremy Walker
Exercism Co-founder & CEO
