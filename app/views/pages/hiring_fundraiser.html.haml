        %strong Become Exercism's Head of Partnerships and Fundraising!
        Are you a strategic thinker? Do you have a track record of identifying and closing sponsorship and partnership deals?
        Do you care about high-quality, free, lifelong education?
        Do you want to work with an exceptional team and help underpin a platform that touches millions of lives?
        If so, this role might be perfect for you.

      %h2.text-h2.mb-12 Summary
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        Exercism is a not-for-profit organisation providing world-class programming education to anyone for free, through a mixture of self-directed learning and mentoring.
        We have grown to nearly a million members, purely by word-of-mouth, and are recognised as one of the leading online education platforms.
        Over the next 5 years, we want to become the defacto programming education platform, that anyone, anywhere can use for free.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        To take our next steps we need to grow our core team, and to do that we need to place ourselves on more solid financial ground.
        We're looking for someone to lead this process, to work with the CEO to create a comprehensive fundraising strategy, and to execute it, raising funds through sponsorship and partnerships.
        Our target is to generate Â£500k of revenue in the next 12 months.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-32
        Exercism is built by a mixture of our full-time core team and thousands of volunteers. The values of kindness, empathy and personal-growth are core to everything we do.
        We're building an exceptional team of ambitious, passionate people who excel at what they do, love their work, and who want to honor the commitment of our thousands of volunteers.
        If that sounds exciting to be part of, and you feel you have the skills to help, we'd love you to apply.

      %h2.text-h2.mb-12 Responsibilities
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        So far, fundraising has been done on an ad-hoc basis by our CEO.
        Over the last 3 years, we have raised ~Â£500k in support from organisations including #{link_to 'Mozilla', 'https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/', target: '_blank'}, #{link_to 'Packt Publishing', 'https://www.packtpub.com/about', target: '_blank'}, #{link_to 'GoBridge', 'https://exercism.org/partners/gobridge', target: '_blank'}, and the #{link_to 'University of Chicago', 'https://www.uchicago.edu/', target: '_blank'}.
        Your role is to take that ad-hoc work, formalise it into a coherent strategy, and then execute on that to deliver Â£500k of new support in the next 12 months.
        If the initial work is successful, we will reinvest some of the revenue into growing a fundraising team around you.
        Although most of your role will be autonomous, but will have close access to the CEO to strategise and explore opportunities as needed.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        The key areas of your work will be:

      %ul.text-p-xlarge.mb-40
        %li Work with the CEO to develop an overarching fundraising strategy.
        %li Identify, approach, and close deals with potential sponsors.
        %li Identify partnership opportunities and work with the CEO to close them.
        %li Identify and apply for grants.

      %h2.text-h2.mb-12 Is this right for you?
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        The right person for this role will be someone with the experience to devise and execute a fundraising strategy, who cares about free lifelong education (preferably programming or STEM), and who shares our values.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        Maybe you're relatively early in your career, looking to take a step up into a position of more responsibility.
        Maybe you're coming towards the end of the career and looking to give back to a not-for-profit.
        Or maybe you're somewhere in between. All are fine by us.
        Similarly, we don't require any specific academic qualifications.
        Our main criteria for hiring will be the belief that you will be able to execute in the role.
        For that, we need to see some track-record of fundraising and/or sales and your ability to think and plan strategically.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-12
        We want to work with people who share our values and who want to build a kind and empathetic workplace, where everyone wants to learn, improve and do great work.
        We have a diverse team and community, where different traits such as skin colors, gender, and sexualities are reflected, and where we do better work because of the different perspectives and insights that different experiences bring.
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-40
        Finally, we want someone who can get passionate about Exercism.
        We're passionate about what we're building - about creating a world-class educational resource that everyone can use for free, and it matters to us that everyone in the team shares that passion.
        You don't have to be a programmer yourself, but hopefully you'll be inspired to learn via Exercism once you start!

      %h2.text-h2.mb-12 Other Requirements
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        We are a fully remote team, and use English as our communication language.
        We aim to mix effective work with a sense of connectedness, so spend some time during the week on video calls sharing ideas and updates, some time doing simpler work while being on Slack, and some time offline focussing on deeper-work.

      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        These lead to the following extra requirements:

      %ul.text-p-xlarge.mb-40
        %li Able to work at least 5 hours per day during 9am - 6pm UTC, to enable you to interact with the rest of the team.
        %li You are willing to travel once per year for an in-person meetup.
        %li You are comfortable using spoken and written English in your job.
        %li You are excited to work in a diverse, inclusive team that cares about culture and where honest, empathic communication is the norm, and self-improvement is a lived value.
        %li You have some interest in tech or programming, and a passion for free education.

      %h2.text-h2.mb-12 Benefits
      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        Treating each other fairly is at the core of our individual and company values, and we want the pay and benefits of Exercism to reflect that.
        We offer the same benefits to all Exercism employees.

      %ul.text-p-xlarge.mb-16
        %li A truly flexible, remote-first, working culture.
        %li A collaborative, creative and inspiring working environment. No shouty bosses, presenteeism or unexpected deadlines.
        %li Â£50k starting salary, which increases each year (inflation + 2%).
        %li Matched pension contributions up to 3%.
        %li 35 days holiday.
        %li We will pay for access to a local co-working space (if desired).

      %p.text-p-xlarge.mb-40
        The role is full time, but you may choose to work either 5 days (~40 hours) per week or 4 days (~32 hours) per week. If you opt for the shorter working week, salary and holiday will be prorated accordingly.
