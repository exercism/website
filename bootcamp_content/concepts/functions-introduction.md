So far we’ve seen that Jiki can follow instructions you give him. But to actually do anything with those, we need to give the workshop it’s next element - **functions.**

Functions are like little machines that you can tell Jiki to use.

```exercism/note
You might remember “functions” from when you’ve studied maths. I **strongly recommend** of thinking of these programming functions as totally different things from those mathematical ones.

Each function has a name, which is how we use it in our code In Jikiscript we write the name using lowercase letters. A name can have multiple words, in which case we separate them using an underscore.

Coding is a little like lego, but rather than little plastic blocks, we have functions. The vast majority of your time coding will be creating functions to do things and then using them in other places in your programs.
