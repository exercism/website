## Array Iteration in JavaScript (vs JikiScript)

In JikiScript, you learned how to iterate through a list and do something with each item (e.g. call a function).

For example, in JikiScript we could write some code to log out all the emojis in a list:

```jikiscript
for each emoji in ["ðŸ˜€", "ðŸš€", "ðŸŒ±"] do
  log emoji
end

// Will log three times:
// ðŸ˜€
// ðŸš€
// ðŸŒ±
```

The equivelent code in JavaScript is very similar.

```javascript
for (const emoji of ["ðŸ˜€", "ðŸš€", "ðŸŒ±"]) {
  log(emoji);
}

// Will log three times:
// ðŸ˜€
// ðŸš€
// ðŸŒ±
```

There are a two changes:

- We use `for (const xxx of xxx)` instead of `for each xxx in xxx`
- Log is a function, not a keyword (so we use it with `()`)

But fundamentally the concept is exactly the same!
