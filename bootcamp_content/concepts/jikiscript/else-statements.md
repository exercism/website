# Else Statements

It's great to be able to use an `if` statement to do something if a condition is `true`.
But what about when a condition is false?

That's where `else` (and `else if` statements come in!)

Else statements allow us to provide a block of code for Jiki to run when the `if` statement's condition is false.

So going back to Jiki functioning as a Robot-bouncer at a club, he could a `reject()` function to send someone away if they're not the right age (rather than just staring silently at them like he did before!)

### Else if

We can chain statements together using `else if`.
And we can still have a final `else` on that too.
