Now you know [what functions are](./functions-introduction), let's look at how we use them.

To start with, we’re going to learn how to use some very basic functions. We’ve created three functions for you - the ones you can see on the shelves in the image above. They’ve all been designed to help a character navigate through a maze.

- `move` - A function that moves the character forward
- `turn_left` - A function that tells the character to turn left.
- `turn_right` - A function that tells the character to turn right

To use a function you specify its name and then two brackets - e.g. `turn_left()`

So if your program was this…

```jikiscript
move();
turn_left();
turn_right();
```

…Jiki would work through each of those instructions. For the first, he’d get the `move()` function off the shelf and to run it. Then he’d move onto the second line and run the `turn_left()` function.

### Don’t try and remember functions!

One of the big mistakes people make when they’re learning is to try and remember all the functions they can use and the inputs they can take etc. This is a ginormous waste of your time. If there are functions that you use often, you’ll naturally remember them. But the rest of the time (and it’s like the 90% majority) you can just look them up. This is normal and expected. I look up functions all the time.

In this course, you’ll always be able to see a list of all the functions you’re expected to use in the instructions, along with a description of what they do and how to use them. And you can also replay your code and see what actually happened using the “Info” button at any time.
