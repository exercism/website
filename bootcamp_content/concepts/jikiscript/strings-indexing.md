# Indexing Strings

We can retrieve a letter from a string using the letter's index.

In JikiScript, we start counting at 1.
So the first item can be accessed via `[1]`, the second via `[2]` etc.

Jiki will scan through the string until he gets to the index you specify.
He then makes a copy of whatever letter he finds as a new string.
If you ask him to, he'll store it in a box.
