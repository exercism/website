# Creating Variables

Let's look at how we make a variable and what happens when we do. For this we use the set keyword.

This is the first time we’ve seen a keyword. Keywords are just words that Jiki understands that you can use to tell him to do things or give him information. In this case set is an instruction to create a new box and put something in it. to is also a keyword that goes along with set.

When Jiki sees set he gets a new box, writes the label on it that you’ve specified, in this case name and then puts the value in that comes after to - in this case it’s the string “Jeremy”.

Once he’s done that, he puts the box on the shelf where he can get it later if we tell him to.
