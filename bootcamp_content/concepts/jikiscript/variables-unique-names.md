# Unique Variable Names

The reason we put labels on the boxes is so that Jiki can find them later. But that means we can only use a label once. If you try and `set` two boxes with the same name, Jiki won't know which one to get.

Similarly, you can't give a box a label if that label is already used by a machine (a function). If there's a machine on a shelf with a label, Jiki won't let you add a box with the same name.
