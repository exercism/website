# Numbers

Numbers are a pretty universal concept and work largely how you’d expect them to in programming

You can add them together, subtract them, multiply them and divide them.

You can have negative numbers (e.g. `-30`).

You can have numbers with decimal points (e.g. `3.14`)

In some languages, you can have scientific notation number like (e.g. `6.022E23` although we don’t use those in JikiScript).

> In programming, try and think of numbers as quite **solid** things rather than a concept. Throughout this course, you’ll see numbers drawn in diagrams as red circles - a bit like tokens that you drop into a machine. Try and imagine numbers like that - things you can hold and do things with. It sounds weird, but it'll help.
