# Introduction to Objects

There are two fundamental ideas in programming:

1. Having information (data) that you read, change and use.
2. Having some sort of functionality that acutally does stuff.

Objects bring these two ideas together into one, allowing you to encapsulate the data and functionality that something might need into... object.

## Example

For example, imagine the laser in the space invaders game.
It needs to know where it is, and information about its status, and it also needs to be able to move and shoot.
