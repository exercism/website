# Changing Variables

You can also tell Jiki to change what’s in the box. For this you use the change keyword.

When Jiki sees the change keyword, he replaces whatever was in the box with whatever you ask him to put in there. So let’s say we want to put a different name into the box, we can say to Jiki:

```
change name to "Aron"
```

He’ll take out there “Jeremy” string that was in there and throw it away. Then he'll put a new string called "Aron" in there instead.
