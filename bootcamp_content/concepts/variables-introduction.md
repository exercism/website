# Introduction to Variables

Probably the most important thing to master in coding is variables. Most people know how to use variables but I don't think many have a good mental model that serves them well in the long term.

We've already looked at Jiki in his factory. He has some shelves with machines on that he can use ("functions"):

If we zoom out a bit, we can see he has a second set of shelves. On these shelves are boxes, which he can store things in.

Each box has a label on it so that Jiki can find it later. And each box has **one** thing inside of it (in JikiScript, every box always has something inside it). The boxes can contain lots of different things - numbers, strings, and lots of other things that we’ll look at throughout this course.

When people talk about a computer’s “memory”, its these shelves that they’re talking about. The size of your computer's memory determines how many boxes you can hold on your shelves.

Creating boxes, changing what’s in them, and using their contents, are three of the most common things you do when programming.
