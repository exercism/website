# What is coding?

## What does it mean to code?

There’s a lot of concepts in computer science and in programming, and if you choose to go down certain rabbit holes, things eventually get pretty complicated. But the **core of coding is quite simple**. We give a computer a set of instructions to follow. And as long as our instructions make sense, the computer will follow them in a total predictable way.

One of the nice things about programming is that **we know exactly what will happen**. If we run the same instructions ten times, the same things will happen ten times. We can introduce random variables if we choose - like letting the computer choose a random number or analyzing some varying data like a image someone uploads or text written in a box - but the way the computer reacts to that will remain entirely predictable and consistent.

**Coding** is the process or writing code. We call those lines of code that we write a **program**. Which is why we also talk about **programming** - the process of making a program. Coding and programming mean the same thing - writing code into a program.

## You’re in charge

One of the most important things to understand when you code is that you’re in charge. The computer is an entirely unintelligent machine that does exactly what you tell it. If it does something weird or unexpected, it’s because you’ve not told it what to do clearly, or not explained how it should handle a certain situation. When a program crashes, or you get the Blue Screen of Death, that’s because a programmer somewhere hasn’t written their code correctly. When your phone or laptop does something that frustrates you, it’s not because the computer is “playing up”, or being “weird” - it’s doing exactly what’s it’s been programmed to do in that situation - the error is in the programming.

It’s important to understand this, because once you grasp that you’re in control, programming stops being scary. At times it can be frustrating or confusing, but it never has to be scary - because everything the computer does will make sense. And if it doesn’t make sense, you have to work out where the instructions you’ve given it are wrong, not get annoyed that the computer is stupid.

Develop a curious mindset and you’ll enjoy coding. When something goes wrong, don’t get annoyed, be curious as to what you’ve missed. Be intrigued by what’s made the computer do something you didn’t expect. The more curious you are, the more you’ll actually understand things, and the more you understand everything, the more predictable things will become.

## Visualising a program

Throughout this course, we’re going to be using a lot of visual images and metaphors to make sense of programming. Trying to think of code in terms of 1s and 0s is a very counterproductive way to learn. Our brains are hardwired to think in real-world terms - things we see and the stories we associate with them. So in this course, we’re going to give our brains lots of images and stories that it can build on as we learn.

Let’s start off with what a program actually looks like. At it’s core we two things:

- The lines of code - you can also think of them as instructions - that you’ve written out.
- The bit of the computer that’s in charge of following those instructions, and carrying them out (we often call this “executing” the lines of code)

We’re going to think of our programs as a workshop that’s run by an old man called Jiki. His life revolves around following the instructions you give to him.

To follow those instructions, he has to understand the language you’re speaking. Jiki understands JikiScript and can follow instructions that you write in JikiScript. If you write instructions in a different language, or make mistakes in what you write, Jiki won’t know what to do, and will either do the wrong thing, or more likely will just say “Nope” and give you an error message.

Different programming languages optimise for different things. Some are very enjoyable to work with, some are very fast to run, some are very specialised to certain scenarios, some are deliberately very general purpose. And every language has different character that runs their code, that speaks that language and follows those instructions.

## What does it mean to read and write a programming language?

Programming languages are called “languages” because they provide a way of communicating (e.g. between you and Jiki). But they’re not really like spoken languages at all, so it’s best not think of them in that way. Instead, think of programming languages as a structured way of a human writing instructions to a computer.

When you learn a programming language, what you’re learning are the different types of instructions it lets you give to a computer and the correct way to write those out. They range from quite straight-forward concepts like “only do this if this thing is true” or “do this thing multiple times”, to more weird abstract ideas - most of which we don’t need for now and can stay away from. These things are your tools when you want to code - they’re the building blocks that enable you to do pretty much anything with a computer.
