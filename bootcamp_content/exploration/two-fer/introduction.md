# Two Fer

## Overview

Two Fer is a classic Exercism exercise.
Through it, we'll explore a few ideas around using _Strings_ and _Conditionals_.

## Introduction

In some English accents, when you say "two for" quickly, it sounds like "two fer". Two-for-one is a way of saying that if you buy one, you also get one for free. So the phrase "two-fer" often implies a two-for-one offer.

Imagine a bakery that has a holiday offer where you can buy two cookies for the price of one ("two-fer one!"). You take the offer and (very generously) decide to give the extra cookie to someone else in the queue.

As you give them the cookie, if you know their name (e.g. they're called "Jeremy"), you say:

```text
"One for Jeremy, one for me."
```

If you don't know their name (even more generous of you!), you say:
"One for you, one for me."

```

```
