# Level 1

Welcome to the Bootcamp!

You're currently on Level 1. Each week we'll unlock a new Level, with new concepts to learn and exercises to solve.

## Your first steps in coding

This week largely revolves around drawing using code.
The objective is for you to be able to draw fun things without feeling like you've having to think too hard about getting the right syntax (ie what to write where).
Your drawing ability should be what limits you - not your coding ability!

We have students on this Bootcamp with a wide range of experience-levels, from total beginners to people in full-time dev jobs.

- For those just starting out, this first week will contain lots of new information and thinking for you to absorb.
  The most important thing is to take your time and build confidence.
- For those who are experienced, these first few weeks will feel familiar and probably quite easy.
  But I strongly advise you to still watch the videos and explore the mental models I'm building, as they will be different from the way you've approached things before.

Most of all, have fun!
