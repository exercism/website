# Level 14

In Level 14 we're going to learn CSS Grid and continue to get more comfortable with JavaScript.

A lot of the JavaScript exercises this week will be familiar to you if you've completed Coding Fundamentals or solved exercises on Exercism before. See if you can make them as idiomatic in JavaScript as possible, and don't be afraid to ask for help/feedback!

Make sure you've watched this week's video to understand these concepts in depth and then have some fun putting them to use!

Good luck, and enjoy!
