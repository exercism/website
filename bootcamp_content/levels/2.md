# Level 2

Welcome to Level 2!

Last week we touched on the absolute basics of coding - using functions. Hopefully you had lots of fun testing your drawing abilities, and getting creative.

In Level 2, we're going to build on what we learned last week, and look at when code moves beyond a linear list of commands, exploring loops, conditionals, variables, and writing our own functions. This is the most full content-rich week of the whole Bootcamp, and we'll cover quite a lot of ground, so take it slowly and make sure you understand each part thoroughly.
