# Level 2

Last week we touched on the absolute basics of coding - using functions. Hopefully you had lots of fun testing your drawing abilities, and getting creative with colors.

In Level 2, we're going to build on what we learned last week, and look at when code moves beyond a linear list of commands, exploring variables and `repeat` blocks.

I think this is one of the most challenge weeks of the whole bootcamp. Stick with it - you'll get through it. Just keep watching back the video if you need a reminder, keep asking yourself what each line of code does and visualise Jiki as you do so.

Good luck, and use our support on Discord and the forum if you get stuck!
