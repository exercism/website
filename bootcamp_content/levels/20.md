# Level 20

Welcome to Level 20 - the final level of the bootcamp.

In the video this week, we explore responsive web design - looking at CSS Variables and Media Queries.

In the exercises, we take a step back to where the Bootcamp began - looking at mazes.

Thank you so much for being part of the bootcamp - I hope you have learned a ton, and had lots of fun on the way!
