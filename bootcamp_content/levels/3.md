# Level 3

This week we introduce a new keyword `if` and it's friend, `else` - together known as "conditionals"

Conditionals are the core of logic in programming.
You'll use them constantly throughout your programming journey.
So practice lots and become good friends with them!

We also look at functions that `return` things.
Remember that they're returning things to **Jiki** to do something with.

All the exercises in Level 3 use conditionals and/or functions that return things. Have fun with them, and don't forget to ask on Discord or the Forum if you get stuck!
