# Level 4

The first three weeks have been a lot of information to take in!
This week is about consolodating the knowledge you've acquired so far!

We only introduce one new concept - how to make your own functions.

We've then given you lots of exercises to help reinforce what you've learnt so far in the course. Remember to ask for help if you get stuck, stay curious, and have fun!
