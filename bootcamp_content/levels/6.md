# Level 6

This week is primarily a recap week, where we explore some of the previous topics.

We only introduce one new ideas - lists inside of lists.
It's not really a new concept, but we can use some nice shortcut notation to make things quite neat and concise.

There's a few new exercises to push you forward, along with your first major project - Tic Tac Toe.
This project isn't intended to be **completed** this week (although you're very welcome to try!)
But the idea is that you work on this alongside other exercises in the coming days/weeks.

Good luck!
