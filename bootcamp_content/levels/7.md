# Level 7

In Level 7 we introduce three things:

1. Another fundamental data type - dictionaries!
2. Two new standalone keywords: `break` and `next` (also known as `continue`).
3. The `indexed by` syntax on loops to enable you to use a built-in counter.

We have a few more string-based exercises and an extra maze exercise.
And we're leaving a little time for you to progress with Tic Tac Toe.

Good luck!
