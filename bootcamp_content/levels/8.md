# Level 8

In Level 8 we start our deep dive into Object Oriented Programming, with its namesake: Objects!

The exercises this week give you a few first steps into instatiating objects (telling Jiki to make them from Blueprints) and using their properties.
It's designed to be a gentle introduction.

The exercises also let you explore dictionaries in a bit more depth and keep pushing your logical thinking.

Have fun!
