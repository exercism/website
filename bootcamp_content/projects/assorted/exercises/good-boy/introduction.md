# Good Boy

In this exercise, we're going to create a little game where you can select the best dog from a selection of photos!

This isn't a hard exercise, but it does have lots of moving parts, so break it down into small pieces and work at each one at a time.

## Instructions

The game is a simple one.
You're shown two dogs and have to click on the one you think is the best (choose your own metric for "best"!).
Every time you click a dog, a tick should appear on it and then the other one should change to a new dog.

Play with the example to get a feel for the game (remember to click Run Code to start it off!)

### API

The API we'll be using for this lives at `https://random.dog/woof.json`.
The API does not have authentication, so you can just use `fetchObject` to retrieve the data without any options.

Remember the format for `fetchObject`:

```javascript
fetchObject(url, options, successFunction, errorFunction);
```

The API returns either images or videos.

For images, you can change the `src` attribute of an `<img />` tag to change the image. For videos, you can change the `src` of a `<video></video>` element. You might like to also set the `autoplay` and `loop` attributes on the video element.

### Design

You can design the game however you like, but try and make it feel as fun and professional as you can!

You might like to explore events like the `load` event on images or the `loadeddata` events on videos to improve the loading experience.

Most of all, have fun!
