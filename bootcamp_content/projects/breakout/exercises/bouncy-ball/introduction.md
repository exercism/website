# Boundaried Ball

Welcome to Breakout!

This was one of my favourite games a kid, and I'm very excited to make it with you here!

By the end of Front-End Fundamentals, you'll have built out a fully working version of this game that you can play, from scratch, using HTML, CSS, and JS.

Those students that took part in Coding Fundamentals will be very familiar with the logic of a lot of the game fundamentals. You'll be able to copy a lot of the logic over to make this easier for you. For those who are new to Front-End Fundamentals, you'll have a little more of the "logic work" to do. But nothing that should be too arduous!

## Self-Completion

In these full Front-end exercises (the ones with HTML, CSS and JavaScript), we're leaving it up to you to mark the solution as completed when you're happy with it.

I'd strongly encourage you to try and get your solution as identical to the example one as possible so that you don't miss out on learning opportunities!

## Instructions

Your job is to create a square game area that takes up 80% of the screen and to add a ball that starts at the bottom middle of the game area and bounces around the walls.

If you do everything correctly, you should be able to overlay your solution onto mine and it should look and work identically!

You can safely let the ball bounce indefinitely.

Good luck!
