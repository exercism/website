# Breakout CSS

Welcome to Breakout!

This was one of my favourite games a kid, and I'm very excited to make it with you here!

By the end of Front-End Fundamentals, you'll have built out a fully working version of this game that you can play, from scratch, using HTML, CSS, and JS.

Those students that took part in Coding Fundamentals will be very familiar with the logic of a lot of the game fundamentals. You'll be able to copy a lot of the logic over to make this easier for you. For those who are new to Front-End Fundamentals, you'll have a little more of the "logic work" to do. But nothing that should be too arduous!

In this first exercise, we're just looking at some basic styling!

## Instructions

Recreate the game using whatever CSS you feel is appropriate.
The colors used are:

- `rgb(10, 18, 21)`
- `rgb(198, 44, 52)`
- `rgb(179, 75, 37)`
- `rgb(184, 138, 12)`
- `rgb(46, 133, 44)`
- `rgb(39, 25, 205)`
- `rgb(188, 198, 200)`
- `white`

I've stuck to pixels in this to try to give you more flexibility in how to solve it (all divisible by `5`). The only exception is that I've used `%` for the border-radius of the ball, and to center things horizontally.
