# Links

Great work getting some basic text added. Now we're going to build on the first exercise and add some links to the different coffee roasters!

Links in HTML are anchor elements, created using the `<a>` tag.
They are content tags so they have open and closing tags.
To specify the link you should use the `href` attribute.
You put whatever you want to show up to the user as the content of the tag.

For example, a link to Exercism would be

```html
<a href="https://exercism.org">Exercism</a>
```

## Instructions

Update the content with links to the various coffee roasters:

- Sweven: `https://swevencoffee.co.uk`
- Glitch: `https://shop.glitchcoffee.com`
- Dak: `https://www.dakcoffeeroasters.com`

Make sure to always include the `https` when linking to external sites, else the browser will treat it as a **relative** link - a link to another page on your own website.
