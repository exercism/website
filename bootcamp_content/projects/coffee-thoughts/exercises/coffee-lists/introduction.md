# Unordered Lists

Our document is starting to take shape. However, it might be a bit more readable if we were using a list, rather than a sentence containing multiple links.

In this exercise, you're going to change the HTML to make use of the unordered list element (`<ul>`) and the list items (`<li>`) it contains.

As with all HTML, the styling on lists can vary, but as a starting point, you can think of these as bullet points.

An unordered list is wrapped with `<ul>` tags, and contains lots of list items (`<li>`) tags. Each list item can contain text and/or other elements.

For example, if we were to list what we've learnt so far:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Headers</li>
  <li>Paragraphs (<strong>My favourite</strong>)</li>
  <li>Links</li>
</ul>
```

Note: Lists should not be placed inside paragraphs. Paragraphs are designed for continuous blocks of text, while lists are separate flow elements for collections of items.

## Instructions

Update the content to use a list rather than paragraphs.

You should also add in the locations that the shops are at, with their flags as emojis. You can find flags on <a href="https://emojipedia.org/flags">on Emojipedia</a>.
