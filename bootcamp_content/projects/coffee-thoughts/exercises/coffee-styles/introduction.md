# Styling

In the last exercise we created a nice list that showed off our favourite coffee roasters. For this exercise, we've removed most of the styling, ready for you to add yourself.

This is the first time you've written any CSS in the Bootcamp - exciting!

## Instructions

Your job is to readd the styling to make your output look like the target.

You need to set the correct styles on the text and separate things properly using `margin`.

### Selectors

For this exercise, there are no class or id attributes on the HTML.
You can use element selectors instead (such as `h1` and `p`).

### Properties

There's a few different CSS properties you need for this exercise. **In order to get things identical, you should be careful to use the units specified below** (e.g. `%` or `px`):

- `font-size`: Used to set the size of the font. For this exercise, use `px` values.
- `font-weight`: Used to change how fat letters appear. For this exercise, you can just set relevant elements to be `bold`.
- `color`: Used to change the color of text. You need `#2b1a0b` (text) and `darkmagenta` (links) for this exercise.
- `text-decoration`: Used to add decorative lines on text. For this exercise, you just need the `underline` value.
- `margin-bottom`: Used to separate things from each other. Use `%` values in this exercise.

### The plan...

I always like to start from top to bottom. Get the heading perfect, then get the paragraph perfect, etc.

For each, start with the font size, then the font weight, then the color and decoration, and finally add a margin.

Once you've got everything right, consider where you have duplication, and if is sensible to combine selectors. See what feels good, and we'll dig into this more in the Labs!
