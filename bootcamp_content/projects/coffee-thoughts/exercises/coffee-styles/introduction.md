# Styling

In the last exercise we created a nice list that showed off our favourite coffee roasters. For this exercise, we've removed most of the styling, ready for you to add yourself.

## Instructions

Your job is to readd the styling to make your output look like the target.

### Properties

There's quite a few different CSS properties you need for this exercise:

- `font-size`: Used to set the size of the font. For this exercise, use `px` values.
- `font-weight`: Used to change how fat letters appear. For this exercise, you can just set relevant elements to be `bold`.
- `color`: Used to change the color of text. You need both `#2b1a0b` and `#442a12` for this exercise.
- `text-decoration`: Used to add decorative lines on text. For this exercise, you just need the `underline` value.
- `margin`: Used to seperate things from each other. Use `%` values in this exercise.

There's some interesting tradeoffs in this exercise about where you can use combined selectors to de-duplicate your code. Experiment and see what feels right to you!
