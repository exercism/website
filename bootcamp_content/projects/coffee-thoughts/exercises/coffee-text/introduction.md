# Basic Text

Welcome to your first HTML exercise.

In this exercise, you'll write your first three HTML tags: `h1`, `p` and `strong`.

These tags are all common tags you'll use on a regular basis.

## Instructions

Your job is to create some HTML with one heading and two paragraphs that match the text displayed in the example.

The text is:

```text
Coffee Thoughts â˜•

There's lots of great coffee out there.

The roasters featured in the live videos include Dak, Glitch, and Sweven. All are very high quality.
```

Notes:

- You need to use one `h1`, two `p` tags and two `strong` tags. Do not use any other tags.
- We've added some styling behind-the-scenes, so once you've got it in place, it should look pretty. You don't need to write any CSS.
- Take care to open, close and nest your tags correctly.

### Suggested workflow

Approaching this exercise in a structured way will make your life easier!
This is how I'd approach it:

1. Start with getting the h1 tag correct as it's the most straightforward.
2. Next add the two paragraph tags so that everything is correct other than the bold text.
3. Finally add the strong tags in the correct places.

Good luck!
