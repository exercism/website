# Padding

So you've now used padding to arrange boxes. In this exercise you're going to use padding's partner in crime - margin.

Margin specifies the space that an element should leave outside of it.

## Instructions

We've given you the same three elements that we gave you in the padding exercise. You need to create exactly the same layout, but this time you should use the `margin` property, not the `padding` property.

Notes:

- We've added the same styling so that the elements have different colours and fill their space. This time all you need to do is update the margin.
- Like last time, as nothing has margin at the start, you can only see the top-most element.
- You can either use the full `margin-xxx` syntax, or the `margin` shortcut syntax.
- All units should be specified as percentages (and they all use numbers divisible by 10).

Again, think about what you're trying to achieve in concrete terms first before you start coding. Maybe use a pen and paper to draw out how margins are different from paddings.
Then choose your selectors (element, id or class), and set the correct properties.
