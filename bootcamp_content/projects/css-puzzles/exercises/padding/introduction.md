# Padding

We're going to start off by looking at a couple of important CSS properties that affect layout.
The first is `padding`.

We've given you there elements nested in each other.
Two of them have ids.
Your job is to add padding where needed.

Notes:

- We've added some styling so that the elements have different colours and fill their space, so all you need to do is update the padding.
- As nothing has padding at the start, you can only see the final section.
- You can either use the full `padding-left` syntax, or the `padding` shortcut syntax.
- All units should be specified as percentages (and they all use numbers divisible by 10).

Think about what you're trying to achieve in concrete terms first before you start coding. Maybe use a pen and paper to draw it out.
Then choose your selectors (element, id or class), and set the correct properties.
