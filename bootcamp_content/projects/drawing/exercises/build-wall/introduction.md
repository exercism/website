# Fix the Wall

In the first drawing exercise you did, you used the `rectangle` and the `fill_color_hex` functions to fill in some gaps in a wall.

In this exercise, we build on that by using the `repeat` keyword to add **lots** of bricks and build a wall.

The final wall should look like this:

<img src="https://assets.exercism.org/bootcamp/graphics/completed-wall.png" style="width: 100%; max-width:400px;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:5px"/>

Things you need to know:

- Each brick is 10 high and 20 wide.
- The rows alternate between bricks starting at the left edge, and bricks that start to the left of that.
- The `rectangle` function can only appear once in your code!
