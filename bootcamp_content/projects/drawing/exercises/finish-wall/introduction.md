# Finish the Wall

In the first drawing exercise you completed, you used the `rectangle` and the `fill_color_hex` functions to fill in some gaps in a wall.

In this exercise, we build on that by using the `repeat` keyword to add the top layer to a wall.

The final wall should look like this.
All the layers other than the top one are already complete.
You need to add the final layer of 5 bricks.

Things you need to know:

- Each brick is 10 high and 20 wide.
- The `rectangle` function can only appear once in your code!
