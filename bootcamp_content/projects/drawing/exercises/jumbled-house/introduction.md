# Jumbled House

Your task is to rearrange the pieces of the house. They are both misplaced and the wrong sizes. Follow the instructions carefully to piece everything together!

It should look like this when it's finished:

Try not to guess at this exercise. Go slowly and precisely. You should be able to work everything out before even pressing Check Scenarios once (although you'll probably need a couple of tries to get it right).

- The frame of the house (the big square) should be 60 wide and 40 height. It should have it's top-left corner at 20x50.
- The roof sits snuggly on top of the house's frame. It should overlap the left and right of the house by 4 on each side. It should have a height of 20, and it's point should be centered horizontally.
- The windows are both the same size, with have a width of 12 and a height of 13. They both sit 5 from the top of the house frame, and 10 inset from the sides.
- The door is 14 wide and 18 tall, and sits at the bottom of the house in the center.
- The little door knob has a radius of 1, is inset 1 from the right, and is vertically centered in the door.
