# Coding Fundamentals Advert

In this exercise you're going to recreate the advert for Coding Fundamentals that sits in the header of Exercism.

## Instructions

Firstly, ensure that you can see all the elements of the target. You might need to zoom out a little to do this. It should look like the image below. It doesn't matter if it's a little different on your screen as long as you can see all the elements.

### Properties

You can use whatever properties you feel are appropriate to solve this exercise.

Here's some notes:

- All sizes are pixels (with one possible exception noted below about making images behave). Nearly all are divisible by 5 (depending on your methodology you might choose to have some single pixel values).
- There are two purples. A lighter one for the border background (`rgb(96 79 205)`) and a darker one (`rgb(19 11 67)`). The button text is `white`.

There are two small details that might be hard to spot:

- The images have a both purple (`rgb(96 79 205)`) and white lines around them.
- The button has a border (`rgb(19 11 67)`).

A final technical note for those who are curious or more advanced. Everything in this exercise has `box-sizing` set to `border-box`, primarily to make laying out the images easier.

### Misbehaving images

One thing that can be a bit confusing is fitting an imagine into a grid slot. If you choose to use grid to solve this exercise, then setting `width: 100%` on the images will mean they obey an grid column instructions you give. This might also be useful in some circumstances with flexbox too!
