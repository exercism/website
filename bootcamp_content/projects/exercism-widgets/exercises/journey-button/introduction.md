# Journey Button

Welcome to a new project, in which you implement widgets that are found on Exercism's site!

You can solve these exercises using whatever method you feel is appropriate. Maybe even experiment with a few different methods?

The first widget is a button that appears on everyone's Exercism dashboard. It links to the beautifully styled Journey page.

## Instructions

You can solve this using whichever properties you want. There are few things you need to know:

**Colors:**

- Light blue: `#e1ebff`
- Dark blue: `#2E57E8`

**Sizes:**

- Everything uses pixels.
- Other than the font-size, everything is divisble by 5.

**Images:**

- `/bootcamp/images/journey.svg`
- `/bootcamp/images/chevron-blue.svg`

Remember to zoom in and out to check that your version works on different screen sizes!
