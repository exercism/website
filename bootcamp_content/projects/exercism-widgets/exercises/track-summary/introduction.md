# Track Progress

Next up we're looking at the track summary widget. This appears in a few places around Exercism. It shows the progress in terms of exercises completed, both with words and a progress bar.

## Instructions

You can solve this using whichever properties you want. 

I would recommend **not** using the `<progress>` HTML element at this stage. 


There are few things you need to know:

**Colors:**
- Dark gray (title): `#130b43`
- Light gray (subtext): `#5c5589`
- Light Blue (background): `rgb(230, 237, 254)`
- Dark Blue (progress bar): `blue`
- White (progress bar) : `white`

**Sizes:**
- Everything uses pixels other than the actual progress on the progress bar.
- Other than the font-size, everything is divisble by 5.
- The progress bar part should have a maximum width of 250px.

**Images:**
- `/bootcamp/images/javascript.svg`
- `/bootcamp/images/chevron-gray.svg`

Remember to zoom in and out to check that your version works on different screen sizes!
