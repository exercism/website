# Flag of Armenia

Let's take a look at a different flag - one that's sort of turned 90 degrees from the one you just completed - the flag of Armenia.

The flag of Armenia has three stripes of equal height.

## Instructions

Behind the scenes we've added some CSS so that your outermost element will fill the space fully.

You should **only** use the following properties:

- `background`: The flag has stripes of of `#F2A800`, `#0033A0` and `#D90012`.
- `display`: Used to turn an element into a flexbox container.
- `flex-direction`: Used to determine the direction that the flex container arranges its items.
- `flex-grow`: Used to specify whether an element should grow to fill the remaining space.
