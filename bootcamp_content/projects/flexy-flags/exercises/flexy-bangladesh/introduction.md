# Flag of Bangladesh

Welcome to a new series of exercises in which you'll use flexbox to recreate various world flags.

In this first exercise, your job is to recreate the flag of Bangladesh. The Bangladesh flag is similar to the Japanese flag in that it has a circle in the middle, but the circle is offset to the left slightly.

## Instructions

Behind the scenes we've added some CSS so that your outermost element will fill the space fully.

You should **only** use the following properties:

- `background`: The Bangladesh flag is a mixture of `#006a4e` and `#f42a41`.
- `border-radius`: Used to round the corners of an element. Use a percentage in this exercise.
- `display`: Used to turn an element into a flexbox container.
- `justify-content`: Used to justify content on the main axis.
- `align-items`: Used to justify content on the secondary axis.
- `flex-basis`: Used to specify the initial size of an element on the main axis. Use percentages in this exercise (divisible by 10).
- `flex-grow`: Used to specify whether an element should grow to fill the remaining space.
- `aspect-ratio`: Used to set the aspect ratio of an element. (e.g. `1` makes something square, `1.5` makes something into a rectangle).
