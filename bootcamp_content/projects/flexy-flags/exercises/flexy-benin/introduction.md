# Flag of Benin

Let's take a look at a flag that combines ideas from the first two - the flag of Benin.

The flag of Benin has a left stripe and the two vertical stripes on the right.

## Instructions

Behind the scenes we've added some CSS so that your outermost element will fill the space fully.

You should **only** use the following properties:

- `background`: The flag has stripes of of `#008751`,`#fcd116` and `#e8112d`.
- `display`: Used to turn an element into a flexbox container.
- `flex-basis`: Used to specify the initial size of an element on the main axis. Use percentages in this exercise (divisible by 10).
- `flex-direction`: Used to determine the direction that the flex container arranges its items.
- `flex-grow`: Used to specify whether an element should grow to fill the remaining space.
