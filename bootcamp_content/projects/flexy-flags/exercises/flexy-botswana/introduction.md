# Flag of Botswana

Let's take a look at a slightly more layered flag - the flag of Botswana.

The flag of Botswana has blue, white and black horizontal stripes.

## Instructions

Behind the scenes we've added some CSS so that your outermost element will fill the space fully.

You should **only** use the following properties:

- `background`: The flag has stripes of of `#6DA9D2`,`white` and `black`.
- `display`: Used to turn an element into a flexbox container.
- `flex-basis`: Used to specify the initial size of an element on the main axis. Use percentages in this exercise (divisible by 10).
- `flex-direction`: Used to determine the direction that the flex container arranges its items.
- `flex-grow`: Used to specify whether an element should grow to fill the remaining space.
- `gap`: Used to specify the gap between elements. Use % value in this exercise (divisible by 5)

Can you solve this exercise with only one outer element and three inner elements?
