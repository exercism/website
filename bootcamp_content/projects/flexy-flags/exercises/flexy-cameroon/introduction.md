# Flag of Cameroon

The flag of Cameroon differs slightly from previous ones in that it has a visual element in the middle.

We've given you that element as an SVG image. You can place it and work with it exactly as you would any other element.

## Instructions

Behind the scenes we've added some CSS so that your outermost element will fill the space fully.

You should **only** use the following properties:

- `background`: The flag has stripes of of `#007a5e`,`#ce1126` and `#fcd116`.
- `display`: Used to turn an element into a flexbox container.
- `flex-basis`: Used to specify the initial size of an element on the main axis. Use percentages in this exercise (divisible by 10).
- `flex-grow`: Used to specify whether an element should grow to fill the remaining space.
- `justify-content`: Used to justify content on the main axis.
- `align-items`: Used to justify content on the secondary axis.
- `width`: You can set the width of the image using this property. It should be a percentage (divisble by 10).

### The SVG image

In case you accidently delete or edit the SVG, here's a copy!

```svg
<svg width="422" height="401" viewBox="0 0 422 401" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path d="M80.5184 400.966L421.6 153.155H0L341.082 400.966L210.8 0L80.5184 400.966Z" fill="#FCD116"/>
</svg>
```
