# Flag of Guinea

Welcome to a new series of exercises in which you'll use flexbox to recreate various world flags.

In this first exercise, your job is to recreate the flag of Guinea. The flag of Guinea has three stripes of equal width.

## Instructions

Behind the scenes we've added some CSS so that your outermost element will fill the space fully.

You should **only** use the following properties:

- `background`: The flag has stripes of of `#ce1126`, `#fcd116` and `#009460`.
- `display`: Used to turn an element into a flexbox container.
- `flex-direction`: Used to determine the direction that the flex container arranges its items.
- `flex-grow`: Used to specify whether an element should grow to fill the remaining space.
