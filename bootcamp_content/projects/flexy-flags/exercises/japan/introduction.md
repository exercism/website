# Flag of Japan

The iconic Japanese flag is has a white background with a red circle in the center. You have no images here - just use CSS to make the circle.

## Instructions

Behind the scenes we've added some CSS so that your outermost element will fill the space fully.

You should **only** use the following properties:

- `background`: The Japanese flag is a mixture of `white` and `#BC002D`.
- `border-radius`: Used to round the corners of an element. Use a percentage in this exercise.
- `display`: Used to turn an element into a flexbox container.
- `justify-content`: Used to justify content on the main axis.
- `align-items`: Used to justify content on the secondary axis.
- `flex-basis`: Used to specify the initial size of an element on the main axis. Use a percentage in this exercise (divisible by 10).
- `aspect-ratio`: Used to set the aspect ratio of an element. (e.g. `1` makes something square, `1.5` makes something into a rectangle).
