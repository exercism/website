# Games and Apps

## Overview

This section is made up of larger projects that you build from scratch.

Rather than hiding away lots of logic, you use what you've learnt so far to make something with far fewer guard-rails than in other exercises.

These exercises are not designed to help you practice one specific idea, but to get you thinking about projects as a whole, and allow you to combine lots of the techniques you've learnt.
