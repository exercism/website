# Rolling ball

Your task to animate the ball to move ("roll") from the tee on the left to the hole on the right.

Some details:

- The ball has a radius of `3`.
- It sits on the grass at a `y` of `75`.
- It starts on the tee at `28` from the left.
- It should roll until it is `88` from the left

You'll need to use the following functions to draw things:

- `clear()` (Remember you need to use this at the start of each iteration)
- `circle(center_x, center_y, radius)`
- `fill_color_hex(hex)`

You'll also need to use the `set`, `change`, and `repeat` keywords.

You can use whatever color your like for the ball, but a bright blue might be helpful as it's a little small to see!

- `fill_color_rgb(red, green, blue)`

If you feel stuck or overwhelmed, watch the Level 2 video back.
