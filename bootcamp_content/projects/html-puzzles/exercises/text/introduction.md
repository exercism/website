# Document Structure

Welcome to your first HTML exercise.

In this exercise, you'll write your first three HTML tags: `h1`, `p` and `strong`.

These tags are all common tags you'll use on a regular basis.

## Instructions

Your job is to create some HTML with one heading and two paragraphs that match the text displayed in the example.

Notes:

- You need to use one `h1`, two `p` tags and two `strong` tags. Do not use any other tags.
- We've added some styling behind-the-scenes, so once you've got it in place, it should look pretty. You don't need to write any HTML.
- Take care to open, close and nest your tags correctly.
