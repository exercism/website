# Solve the Maze

Your task is to solve the following maze.

You have three functions you can use:

- `move()` which moves the character one step forward
- `turn_left()` turns the character left (relative to the direction they're currently facing)
- `turn_right()` turns the character right (relative to the direction they're currently facing)

Remember to use one function per line.
