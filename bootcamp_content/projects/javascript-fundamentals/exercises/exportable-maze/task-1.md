# Task 1

We've started by adding a single `move()` for you, which will move the character one step forward.

Use the "Run code" button to see how close you're getting.

It's good practice to get into the habit of running your code reguarly.
In this exercise, we'd recommend running it after adding each new instruction, although you might like to try and challenge yourself to solve it all in one go instead!
