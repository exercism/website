# Lasagna

Lucian's girlfriend is on her way home, and he hasn't cooked their anniversary dinner!

In this exercise, you're going to write some code to help Lucian cook an exquisite lasagna from his favorite cookbook.This should feel quite straightforward for you, but give you a basic sense of working with JavaScript.

## Instructions

You have three tasks related to the time spent cooking the lasagna.

### 1. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes

Implement the `remainingMinutesInOven` function that takes the actual minutes the lasagna has been in the oven as a _parameter_ and _returns_ how many minutes the lasagna still has to remain in the oven, based on the **expected oven time in minutes** from the previous task.

```javascript
remainingMinutesInOven(30);
// => 10
```

### 2. Calculate the preparation time in minutes

Implement the `preparationTimeInMinutes` function that takes the number of layers you added to the lasagna as a _parameter_ and _returns_ how many minutes you spent preparing the lasagna, assuming each layer takes you 2 minutes to prepare.

```javascript
preparationTimeInMinutes(2);
// => 4
```

### 3. Calculate the total working time in minutes

Implement the `totalTimeInMinutes` function that takes _two parameters_: the `numberOfLayers` parameter is the number of layers you added to the lasagna, and the `actualMinutesInOven` parameter is the number of minutes the lasagna has been in the oven. The function should _return_ how many minutes in total you've worked on cooking the lasagna, which is the sum of the preparation time in minutes, and the time in minutes the lasagna has spent in the oven at the moment.

```javascript
totalTimeInMinutes(3, 20);
// => 26
```
