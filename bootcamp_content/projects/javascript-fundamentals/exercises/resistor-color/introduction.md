# Resistor Color

If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.

This is the first of three exercises in which we'll be looking at the colors on resistors!

## Instructions

For this exercise, you need to know two things about them:

- Each resistor has a resistance value.
- Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.

To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.
Each band has a position and a numeric value.

The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number.

In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.

These colors are encoded as follows:

- black: 0
- brown: 1
- red: 2
- orange: 3
- yellow: 4
- green: 5
- blue: 6
- violet: 7
- grey: 8
- white: 9

Create a function called `colorCode` that takes a color as a string and returns its code as a number.
