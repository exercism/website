# Length

Welcome to the second Library Function Exercise.

In this exercise, we're following the same process as in the previous "Length" exercise:

1. Write the library function
2. Import it (using the dependencies button)
3. Finish the exercise.

Note that you might need to refresh this page in between writing your library function and importing it!

## Contains

This exercise needs you to create the [`my#contains`](/bootcamp/custom_functions/contains/edit) function.

The contains function takes two inputs:

1. The thing you're looking in.
2. The thing you're looking for.

You can look for a letter in a string (e.g. `"Rubber Duck"` contains a `"D"`), or you can look for an item in a list (e.g. `["Dog", "Duck", "Chicken"]` contains `"Duck"`).

If you've completed the Guest List exercise, you might recognise this pattern.
In fact you might be able to copy, paste and refine your Guest List code to make this library function!

You'll be using this function in a lot of the exercises that follow!

## Instructions

Once you've got the function working and imported, you need to finish the exercise.

The scenarios expect you to return one of two strings. Either:

- `"It's there! ðŸ™‚"`
- `"It's not there ðŸ˜”"`
