# Length

Welcome to the second Library Function Exercise.

In this exercise, we're doing exactly the same as the previous Length exercise.
Your job is to:

1. Write the library function
2. Import it (using the dependencies button)
3. See if it works!

Note that you might need to refresh this page in between writing your library function and importing it!

## Contains

This exercise needs you to create the [`my#contains`](/bootcamp/custom_functions/contains/edit) function.

The contains function takes two inputs:

1. The thing you're looking in.
2. The thing you're looking for.

You can look for a letter in a string (e.g. `"Rubber Duck"` contains a `"D"`), or you can look for an item in a list (e.g. `["Dog", "Duck", "Chicken"]` contains `"Duck"`).

You'll be using this custom function in a lot of the exercises that follo!

Go [write that function](/bootcamp/custom_functions/contains/edit), then come back here, refresh the page, add it to your dependencies, then hit Check Scenarios to see if it works.
