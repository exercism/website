# Length

Welcome to the first Library Function Exercise!

## Your Library

You now have access to your own [personal Functions Library](/bootcamp/custom_functions), where you can create functions that you need frequently in exercises.
You create them in your library them import them into your exercises using the "Dependencies" button above.
You can add whatever functions you like to the library, but there are a few that are pre-created waiting for you to fill them in.

[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/live/00tNx4XCJxY?t=1403s) to watch the introduction session on Library Functions.

## The Exercise

These Library Function Exercises all follow the same pattern.
The first part of the solution is prewritten.
It uses a library function that you need to write.

Your job is to:

1. Write the library function (if you haven't already)
2. Import it (using the "Dependencies" button)
3. Finish off the exercise

Note that you need to refresh this page in between writing your library function and importing it.

## Length

This first exercise needs you to create the [`my#length`](/bootcamp/custom_functions/length/edit) function.

The length function takes one input - either a string or a list - and returns its length.
It's one of the foundational functions that a lot of your other functions will be based on.

## Instructions

Once you're done writing that function, you need to form a sentence with its result. If the input was `"Hello"`, The sentence should be:

```
The length is 5.
```

You have the two functions available:

- `concatenate(str1, str2, ...)`: Takes 2 or more strings as inputs, and returns them joined together.
- `number_to_string(number)`: Takes a number as an input and returns it turned into a string.
