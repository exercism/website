# Length

Welcome to the first Library Function Exercise.

These exercises all follow the same pattern.
The first part of the solution is prewritten, using one or more of your library functions.

Your job is to:

1. Write the library function (if you haven't already)
2. Import it (using the dependencies button)
3. Finish off the exercise

Note that you might need to refresh this page in between writing your library function and importing it!

## Length

This first exercise needs you to create the [`my#length`](/bootcamp/custom_functions/length/edit) function.

The length function takes one input - either a string or a list - and returns its length.
It's one of the foundational functions that a lot of your other functions will be based on.

## Instructions

Once you're done writing that function, you need to form a sentence with its result. If the input was `"Hello"`, The sentence should be:

```
The length is 5.
```

You have the two functions available:

- `concatenate(str1, str2, ...)`: Takes 2 or more strings as inputs, and returns them joined together.
- `number_to_string(number)`: Takes a number as an input and returns it turned into a string.
