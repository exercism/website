# Length

Welcome to the first Library Function Exercise.

These exercises all follow the same pattern.
The solution to the exercise is prewritten - it simply refers to one of your library functions.

Your job is to:

1. Write the library function
2. Import it (using the dependencies button)
3. See if it works!

Note that you might need to refresh this page in between writing your library function and importing it!

## Length

This first exercise needs you to create the [`my#length`](/bootcamp/custom_functions/length/edit) function.

The length function takes one input - either a string or a list - and returns its length.
It's one of the foundational functions that a lot of your other functions will be based on.

Go [write that function](/bootcamp/custom_functions/length/edit), then come back here, refresh the page, add it to your dependencies, then hit Check Scenarios to see if it works.
