# Even or odd

Let's build a function that takes a _number_ as an input and returns a _string_ specifying whether it's `"Even"` (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, etc), or `"Odd"` (1, 3, 5, 7, etc) or `"Zero"`.

To approach this problem, think about what it is that acutally makes a number odd or even.

  A good way of working out if a number is even or odd is to check whether it has a remainder when it's divided by 2.

You probably remember from school that a remainder is what’s left over when you divide a number but can’t divide it evenly. In other words, it’s the part of the number that doesn’t fit into equal groups.

For example, if you divide 7 by 3, you can fit two groups of 3 into 7 (since 3 + 3 = 6), but there’s 1 left over. That leftover 1 is the remainder. And that remainder makes it an odd number.

So to solve this exercise, you might like to use the **[remainder operator]()**.
