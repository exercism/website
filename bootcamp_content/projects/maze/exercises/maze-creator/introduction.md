# Maze Creator

The bootcamp started by us looking at mazes.
In this exercise, you're going to create some code that can easily create mazes.

In the stub we've given you

## Instructions

Create a maze and a character that can be controlled by writing instructions into a text area and pressing the "Run Code" button.

Note, your not actually intended to run the code in the box, but instead interpret what's there and act upon each line you find.

You should intepret the following three lines of code and the blob should move accordingly:

- `move()`
- `turn_left()`
- `turn_right()`

The blob you're controlling should move smoothly around the game area and you should inform a user whether their code solved the maze or not!

Check the example for the target maze layout!
