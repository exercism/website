# Maze Instructions

In the very first exercise of the Bootcamp, students (maybe you!) had to give instructions to a little blob to solve a maze. You had various commands like `move()` and `turn_left()`. In this exercise, you're going to recreate that whole exericse yourself!

## Instructions

Create a maze and a character that can be controlled by writing instructions into a text area and pressing the "Run Code" button.

Note, your not actually intended to run the code in the box, but instead interpret what's there and act upon each line you find.

You should intepret the following three lines of code and the blob should move accordingly:

- `move()`
- `turn_left()`
- `turn_right()`

The blob you're controlling should move smoothly around the game area and you should inform a user whether their code solved the maze or not!

Check the example for the target maze layout!
