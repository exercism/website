# Maze Instructions

In the last exercise, you built and solved the exercise yourself, just like you did in the first exercise of Part 1. Now let's take that one step further and add the instructions pane as you had it in part 1. Your job is to interpret the instructions someone gives and run their code!

## Instructions

You have two tasks:

1. Add the instructions pane.
2. Run the code in the instructions box when the Run Code button is added.

The actual game doesn't need to change much from the previous exercise.

One challenge you might have is chaining the promises. You might like to explore an approach using [`reduce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) seeded by a `Promise.resolve()` (see [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve)).

Once you've solved this exercise, you've truly gone from being the student to being the teacher - creating your own exercise that anyone else can solve. Congratulations!
