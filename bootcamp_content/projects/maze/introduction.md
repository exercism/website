# Maze

## Overview

Mazes are a fun way to explore lots of programming concepts. We'll start by writing code to solve them manually, then build a program to solve them automatically, before looking at how to generate mazes from scratch.

Mazes also contain lots of concepts you can use to build games or learn algorithms.

This project contains the first exercise you ever do, and continues all the way through into Part 2.
