# Borders

Nice work on nailing padding and margin. Those are two concepts that you're going to be using constantly. Once we're passed these first few exercises, you'll use them in everything, so you'll get lots of practice!

Now we're going to move onto another common property - borders.
Borders draw some color around an element. You can set `border-width`, `border-color` and `border-style` properties.

## Instructions

We've given you the same three elements that we gave you in the previous exercises, but this time we've added some padding for you.
Your job is to add the borders to match the target.

Notes:

- The border colors are `green`, `blue`, and `red`.
- Valid style properties are `dotted`, `dashed` and `solid`.
- You can specify styles using `border` shotcut syntax, the `border-xxx` syntax, or the `border-top-xxx` syntax.
- All units should be specified as **pixels** and will round numbers.
