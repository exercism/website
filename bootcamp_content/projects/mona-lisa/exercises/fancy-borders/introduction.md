# Borders

You've now explored making the same design with `padding` and `margin`. We're now going to look at once more way to do the same thing - with borders!

As you'll remember from the video, borders are a decorative element that goes around an element. You can set different border widths, styles and colors.

## Instructions

We've given you the same elements that we gave you in the first exercise. The layout is almost identical, but this time we're making it slightly more "funky" looking.

You need to set four borders - one of each `solid`, `dashed`, `dotted` and `double`. You also need to set one `border-radius`.
Use `px` as the unit for the border sizes.

The five colors of the borders are `saddlebrown`, `white`, `gold`, `#f5f5dc` and `rgba(175, 116, 24, 0.5)`.

Notes:

- We've added some background colors to help with the visuals.
- You can either use the full `border-xxx` syntax, or the `border` shortcut syntax.
- All units should be specified as pixels.
- You should **only** use the `border`, `border-radius` and `background` properties to solve this.

Again, think about what you're trying to achieve in concrete terms first before you start coding. Maybe use a pen and paper to draw out how you think the borders are working in the sample drawing.
