# Margin

Welcome to your first CSS exercise!

In this exercise, we're going to create a frame for a picture of the Mona Lisa.

You'll hopefully remember from the video that padding is responsible for adding space **inside** an element.

## Instructions

We've given you the HTML for this exercise.
You don't need to change that, but you do need to read it to discover your selectors.

We've also written some CSS behind-the-scenes, which means the divs sit inside each other nicely. You don't need to worry about that for now - you just need you to implement two properties: `padding` and `background`.

The colors you need are:

- Wood: `#4e342e`
- Glass: `white`
- Rim Gold: `#d4af37`
- Canvas: `#f5f5dc`

Notes:

- As nothing has padding at the start, you can only see the top-most element.
- You can either use the full `padding-xxx` syntax, or the `padding` shortcut syntax.
- All units should be specified as pixels.

One really important skill to learn is to be able to see where your implementation is different to a design. So **try and work out the values by eye** and then use the Curtain/Diff tools to check them when needed.

Also, think about what you're trying to achieve in concrete terms first before you start coding. Maybe use a pen and paper to draw out how you think the padding should work.

Good luck!
