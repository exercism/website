Welcome to the first HTML/CSS Exercise.

In all exercises of this type, your job is to replicate what you see in the "Target" window by writing code in the HTML and CSS editors.

When you think you've got it right, you can click "Check Result" to check.

You also have two buttons:

- **Curtain**: This allows you to toggle a curtain effect on your result. Turn it on and hover over your result to see how it compares to the target.
- **Diff**: This button shows the difference between your result and the target. If something is red, that means it's wrong. The more red it is, the more wrong it is.

## Instructions

In this exercise, we're going to create a frame for a picture of the Mona Lisa using padding. You'll hopefully remember from the video that padding is responsible for adding space **inside** an element.

We've given you the HTML for this exercise.
You don't need to change that, but you do need to read it to discover your selectors.

We've also written some CSS behind-the-scenes, which means the divs sit inside each other nicely. You don't need to worry about that for now - you just need you to implement two properties: `padding` and `background`.

The colors you need are:

- Wood: `#4e342e`
- Glass: `white`
- Rim Gold: `#d4af37`
- Canvas: `#f5f5dc`

Notes:

- As nothing has padding at the start, you can only see the top-most element.
- You can either use the full `padding-xxx` syntax, or the `padding` shortcut syntax.
- All units should be specified as `px`.

One really important skill to learn is to be able to see where your implementation is different to a design. So **try and work out the values by eye** and then use the Curtain/Diff tools to check them when needed.

Also, think about what you're trying to achieve in concrete terms first before you start coding. Maybe use a pen and paper to draw out how you think the padding should work.

Good luck!
