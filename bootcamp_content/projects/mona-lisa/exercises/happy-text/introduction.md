# Happy text

Welcome to the first CSS Exercise.

In all of these exercises your job is to replicate what you see in the "Expected" window, but writing code in the HTML and CSS editors.

When you think you've got it, you can click "Compare" to double check.

## Instructions

In this exercise, you need to make some happy text appear.

### HTML

The HTML for this is very simple.
You should only add a single element containing the text "I'm very happy! ðŸŽ‰"
You should give it the identifer `"happy-text"`.

### CSS

For the CSS, you have two jobs:

1. Style the text. You should use the properties:

- `font-size`: Use % as the unit.
- `font-weight`
- `text-align`
- `color`: Use `"#CB00F5"` as the color.

2. Style the box that the text is in. You'll need to use:

- `margin`: The space around the box. Use % as the unit.
- `padding`: The space inside the box. Use % as the unit.
- `background-color`: Use `#17183B`
  Remember that the margin goes outside the box, and the padding goes inside it!
