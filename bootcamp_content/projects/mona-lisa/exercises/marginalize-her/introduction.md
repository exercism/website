# Margins

For the first 400 years of its existance, almost no-one knew of the Mona Lisa - you might say the painting was somewhat marginalized outside of the art-world.

In this exercise, we're doing a different type of marginalizing - we're using margins instead of paddings! _(I apologise for the tenuous link)_

Remember from the videos that margins specifies the space that an element should leave outside of it.

## Instructions

We've given you the same elements that we gave you in the first exercise. You need to create exactly the same layout, but this time you should use the `margin` property, not the `padding` property.

Notes:

- You can either use the full `margin-xxx` syntax, or the `margin` shortcut syntax.
- All units should be specified as pixels.

Again, think about what you're trying to achieve in concrete terms first before you start coding. Maybe use a pen and paper to draw out how margins are different from paddings.
