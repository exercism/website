# Margins

Last time you successfully added a frame to the Mona Lisa using padding. This time we're going to use margins instead.

Remember from the videos that margins specifies the space that an element should leave outside of it.

## Instructions

We've given you the same elements that we gave you in the first exercise. You need to create exactly the same layout, but this time you should use the `margin` property, not the `padding` property.

Notes:

- You can either use the full `margin-xxx` syntax, or the `margin` shortcut syntax.
- All units should be specified as `px`.

Again, think about what you're trying to achieve in concrete terms first before you start coding. Maybe use a pen and paper to draw out how margins are different from paddings.
