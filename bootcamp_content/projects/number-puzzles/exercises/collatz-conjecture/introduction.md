# Introduction

One evening, you stumbled upon an old notebook filled with cryptic scribbles, as though someone had been obsessively chasing an idea.
On one page, a single question stood out: **Can every number find its way to 1?**
It was tied to something called the **Collatz Conjecture**, a puzzle that has baffled thinkers for decades.

The rules were deceptively simple:

1. Choose a number.
2. If it's even, divide it by 2.
3. If it's odd, multiply it by 3 and then add 1.
4. Repeat 2-4 with the result, continuing indefinitely.

### An example

Curious, you chose the number 12 to test, and began the journey:

```
12 ➜ 6 ➜ 3 ➜ 10 ➜ 5 ➜ 16 ➜ 8 ➜ 4 ➜ 2 ➜ 1
```

Counting from the second number (6), it took 9 steps to reach 1, and each time the rules repeated, the number kept changing.
At first, the sequence seemed unpredictable — jumping up, down, and all over.
Yet, the conjecture claims that no matter the starting number, **we'll always end at 1.**

It was fascinating, but also puzzling.
Why does this always seem to work?
Could there be a number where the process breaks down, looping forever or escaping into infinity?
The notebook suggested solving this could reveal something profound — and with it, fame, [fortune][collatz-prize], and a place in history awaiting whoever could unlock its secrets.

## Instructions

Create a function called `collatz_steps` that takes one input, a number. Return **how many steps** it takes to get from any given number, to 1, following the rules of the Collatz Conjecture.

You might like to use a new keyword in this exercise: `repeat_forever`.
It works like this:

```
repeat_forever do
  // Anything in here repeats forever
  // until you tell Jiki to return
end
```
