# Positive, Negative or Zero

Welcome to a new type of exercise!

In this type of exercise, rather than writing code that Jiki runs, your job is to create a function. **We** then ask Jiki to use your function in different scenarios.

We've written out the start of the function for you, and locked those lines so you don't accidently edit them. Your job is to write the code inside the function to solve the exercise.

## Instructions

The aim of this exercise is to build a function called `positive_negative_or_zero` that takes a _number_ as an input and returns a _string_ specifying whether it's `"Positive"` (greater than zero), `"Negative"` (less than zero) or `"Zero"`.

We've given you different scenarios that test different numbers to check your function works correctly.

Good luck!
