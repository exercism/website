# Flag of Portugal

Welcome to a new set of Flag exercises. In these you're free to use whatever properties you like. However, you'll probably want to use the properties you learnt in level 15 (e.g. `position` and `transform`) in many of the exercises.

To start with we look at Portugal. This is a straightforward split background, with a single element positioned across the intersection of the two colors.

## Instructions

Behind the scenes we've added some CSS so that your outermost element will fill the space fully.

- The green is `#060` and the red is `#f00`.
- The image lives at `/bootcamp/images/portugal.svg`.
- The target implementation uses `%` divisible by 10 for all its numeric values.

Good luck!
