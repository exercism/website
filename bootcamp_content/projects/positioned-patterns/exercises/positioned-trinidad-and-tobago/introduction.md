# Flag of Trinidad and Tobago

Next up we have the flag of Trinidad and Tobago.

This is the first flag where you have things working at a diagonal.

To start with we look at Portugal. This is a straightforward split background, with a single element positioned across the intersection of the two colors.

## Instructions

Behind the scenes we've added some CSS so that your outermost element will fill the space fully.

- The red is `#da1a35`. The stripes are `black` and `white`
- In the target implementation, the white stripes use pixels (divisible by 10) and all the other numeric values are `%` divisible by 5.

To achieve the diagonal with straight-forward numbers, you'll likely want to use `transform` with a rotation value combined with the [`transform-origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-origin) property!

Good luck!
