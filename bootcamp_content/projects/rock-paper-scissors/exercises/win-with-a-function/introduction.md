# Part 1

We're going to start off by determining who wins a game of rock-paper-scissors by creating the function `who_wins`.

The function takes two inputs - `player_1_choice` and `player_2_choice`, which can be `"rock"`, `"paper"` or `"scissors"`.

Your job is to return the winner (`"player_1"`, `"player_2"`, or `"tie`") based on the following rules:

- Paper beats Rock
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beat Paper
