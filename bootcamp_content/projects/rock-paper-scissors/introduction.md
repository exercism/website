# Rock Paper Scissors

## Overview

Rock Paper Scissors is a class game played around the world by people of all ages.

We're going to build out this whole game, starting by implementing the logic of who wins using _Conditionals_, adding a way of keeping score using _Variables_, and eventually building out all the visuals in Part 2 of the course.

## Introduction

Rock, Paper, Scissors is one of those games everyone seems to know. It’s quick, simple, and surprisingly fun for how basic it is. Whether you’re trying to decide who gets the last slice of pizza or just passing time with a friend, this game has a way of making even small decisions feel epic. The best part? You don’t need any equipment—just your hands and a little competitive spirit.

The rules are simple.

Both players choose one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Choices are revealed simultaneously and the winner is determined based on these rules:
• Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors).
• Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cut Paper).
• Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock).
If both players choose the same option, it’s a tie, and the round is replayed (optional based on how you’re playing).

You and your opponent pick one of three options—Rock, Paper, or Scissors—and reveal your choices at the same time. Rock beats Scissors (because it crushes it), Scissors beats Paper (because it cuts it), and Paper beats Rock (because it covers it). If you both pick the same thing, it’s a tie, and you go again. You can play a single round to settle something quickly or go best out of three for a proper showdown. It’s easy to learn, impossible to master, and always a good time.
