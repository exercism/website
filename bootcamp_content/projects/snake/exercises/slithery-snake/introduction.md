# Slithery Snake

Welcome to Snake!

In this project we're going to recreate the classic Nokia game!
I wasted a lot of time on this as a kid, and I'm excited to make and play it again with you!

## Self-Completion

This exercise has self-completion. I'd strongly encourage you to try and get your solution as identical to the example one as possible so that you don't miss out on learning opportunities!

## Instructions

Your job is to create a square game area that takes up 80% of the screen and to add a snake that moves around. For now, you should just get the snake starting in the center moving around the edges.

If you do everything correctly, you should be able to overlay your solution onto mine and it should look and work identically!

You can choose whatever colors your like. Each snake segment in my example solution is `5%` of the game area, and it keeps `5%` from the edge of the board.

As long as you don't keep creating unlimited elements, you can safely let the snake move indefinitely.

## Segments

The secret to solving this exercise is to think in segments. Rather than trying to move the snake element, think about how to move it's segments.

Good luck!
