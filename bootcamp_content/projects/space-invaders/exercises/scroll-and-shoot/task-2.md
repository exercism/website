# Bonus Task

Solving this exercise is a big achievement. Congratulations!!

Do you want to challenge yourself even more? Try thse two tasks:

1. Do not use the `repeat` keyword? (You can still use `repeat_until_game_over`).
2. Only have `shoot()` appear once in your code?

It's not easy, but you'll be very proud of yourself if you can piece it together.
