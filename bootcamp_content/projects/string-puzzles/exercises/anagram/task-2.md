# Bonus Tasks

You have two bonus tasks:

The first is to make your own [`my#sort_string`](/bootcamp/custom_functions/sort_string/edit) function rather than using the built-in sort_string.

The second is tougher: Can you sort the anagrams so that they're returned in alphabetical order? For example:

```jikiscript
find_anagrams("stone", ["tones", "banana", "notes", "Seton"])

// Should return...
// ["Seton", "notes", "tones"]
```

_(Note: Capital letters come before lowercase letters)._

You might find your [`my#char_code`](/bootcamp/custom_functions/char_code/edit) custom function to be helpful as a way of determining the order of words.

There are lots of ways you can sort a list - there's no right or wrong. Try and work something out yourself, but if you get really stuck don't be afraid to Google around and look up some different conceptual approaches to sorting (e.g. "insertion sort" or "bubble sort"), then try and code those yourself!
