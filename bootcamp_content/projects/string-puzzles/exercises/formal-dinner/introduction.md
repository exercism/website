# Formal Dinner

Your back in your side hustle as a bouncer.
It's the evening after the After Party, and there's yet another shindig.
This time it's a formal dinner.

This definitely isn't the place to use **just** your first name.
In fact it's the place to use your first name at all.
Here, everyone goes by a honorifics (Miss, Mr, Dr, etc) and surnames.

Once again, though, your list of names is just people's full names.
So when Mr Pitt turns up, you need to work out that this is the "Brad Pitt" on your guest list.

## Instructions

Write a function called `on_guest_list`.
The function has two inputs.
The first will contain the guest_list as a list of strings.
The second is the name of the person formatted as honorific and a surname.
You should return if the person is on the guest list.

For this task, you can presume that honorifics will always be one word.
