# Guest List

You're a bouncer at at the Oscars, and need a function to check if someone is on the Guest List.

To help you, you need to write a function called `on_guest_list`.

The function has two inputs.
The first expects the guest_list to be passed as a list of strings.
The second is the name of the person you need to check as a string.
You should return if the person is on the guest list.

Imagine real life. You have list and you need to see if there is a name on it. What do you do?

You read through the list and check to see if each entry on the list matches the name.

Do the same here! ðŸ™‚
