# Guest List

You're a bouncer at the Oscars, and need a function to check if someone is on the Guest List.

To help you, you need to write a function called `on_guest_list`.

The function has two inputs.
The first expects the guest_list to be passed as a list of strings.
The second is the name of the person you need to check as a string.
You should return if the person is on the guest list.

## Hints

Imagine real life. You have a list and you need to see if there is a name on it. What do you do?

You read through the list and check to see if each entry on the list matches the name.

Do the same here! 🙂

It will **really** help you to think through what you'd do in the real world here.

Imagine you have a guest list.
Imagine you have a name.

How do you see whether the name is on the list. At what point(s) do you announce whether it is or isn't? Very carefully step through each thing you'd do in the real world.

Try and model that code the same!
