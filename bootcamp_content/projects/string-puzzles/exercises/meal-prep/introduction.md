# Meal Prep

You're the sort of person that likes to pop to the shops each day to get whatever ingredients you need for dinner.
It gives you a nice excuse to stretch your legs and chat to the local shopkeeper.

Each day you choose a recipe, then check what's in the fridge, and note down what you need to buy.

Now you've decided to make your life a little easier, by writing a program to do the hard work for you!

## Instructions

Write a function called `shopping_list`.
It takes two inputs.
The first is the contents of your fridge as a list of strings.
The second are the items in the recipe, also as a list of strings.
It should return the things you need to buy, as a list of strings.

You have one function avaiable:

- `push(list, element)`: This adds an element to a list, then returns the new list. (e.g. `push(["a"], "b") â†’ ["a", "b"]`)

Remember to write out your method of solving this on pen and paper.
Try and replicate what you would do in the real world! Good luck and ask for help if you get too stuck!
