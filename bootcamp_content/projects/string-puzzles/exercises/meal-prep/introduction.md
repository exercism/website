# Meal Prep

You're the sort of person that likes to pop to the shops each day to get whatever ingredients you need for dinner.
It gives you a nice excuse to stretch your legs and chat to the local shopkeeper.

Each day you choose a recipe, then check whats in the fridge, and note down what you need to buy.

Now you've decided to make your life a little easier, by writing a program to do the hard work for you!

## Instructions

Write a function called `shopping_list`.
It takes two inputs.
The first is the contents of your fridge as a list of strings.
The second are the items in the recipe, also as a list of strings.
It should return the things you need to buy, as a list of strings.

You have one function avaiable:

- `push(list, element)`: This adds an element to a list, then returns the new list. (e.g. `push(["a"], "b") â†’ ["a", "b"]`)
