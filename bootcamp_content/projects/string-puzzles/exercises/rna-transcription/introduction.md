# RNA Transcription

Our second molecular biology exercise looks at RNA as well as DNA!

# Introduction

You work for a bioengineering company that specializes in developing therapeutic solutions.

Your team has just been given a new project to develop a targeted therapy for a rare type of cancer.

It's all very complicated, but the basic idea is that sometimes people's bodies produce too much of a given protein.
That can cause all sorts of havoc.

But if you can create a very specific molecule (called a micro-RNA), it can prevent the protein from being produced.
This technique is called [RNA Interference][rnai].

## Instructions

Your task is to determine the RNA complement of a given DNA sequence.

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**), and thymine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**), and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:

- `G` -> `C`
- `C` -> `G`
- `T` -> `A`
- `A` -> `U`

Create a function called `dna_to_rna(dna)`.
It should take a DNA string as it's input, and should return a string representing the RNA equivelent.

### Functions

For this exercise, you have one function available:

- `join(str1, str2)`: This takes two strings and outputs them joined together.
