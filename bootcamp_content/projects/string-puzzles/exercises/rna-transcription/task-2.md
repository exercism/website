# Bonus Tasks

Great work on solving the exercise.
Let's see if we can push you a little harder!
Try these three tasks:

1. Only have `concatenate` appear once in your code.
2. Do not directly check whether the nucleotide is equal to a specific letter (i.e. no `nucleotide == "G"`)
3. With both the other bonus tasks still honoured, get it down to 18 lines of code.
