# Bootcamp Features

In this exercise, your job is to replicate the features section from the top of the Bootcamp landing page.

I've left the HTML and CSS almost exactly as it is on the page, so you're coding CSS for real here!

## Instructions

We've set up the body to the have the correct color, and for your top-most element to sit centralised. Everything else is down to you!

You can use any properties we've covered so far. To help you out here are a few facts about my implementation:

- The images have widths and heights of `16px`.
- The font is sized `15px` and I use both `400` and `600` font weights.
- All other values are in increments of `5px`.
- I used image tags, not background images.
- The text color is `#333`.

The image URLs are:

- `/bootcamp/images/bc-live.svg`
- `/bootcamp/images/bc-fun.svg`
- `/bootcamp/images/bc-help.svg`

Have fun!
