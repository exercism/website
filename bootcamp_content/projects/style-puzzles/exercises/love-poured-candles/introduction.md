# Love-Poured Candles

In this exercise, your job is to make a business card for a Candle Maker.

You have a blank slate, and there's lots of ways you can do things, but we've put some guidance below.

## Instructions

Firstly, create your HTML structure. Work top-to-bottom and lay out the code in the most logical way you can. Then add the CSS next. Finally work out how to add the image where you want it.

We've setup the exercise so that the first element you create will fill all the horizontal space but not the vertical space.

You need two images (both of which should be set as background images):

- The paper texture image is available at `/bootcamp/images/paper-texture.jpg`. This image should `cover` the card, be positioned at the `top left`, and it **should** repeat (if you're interested, check what happens when you toggle this - can you see the subtle difference?)
- The candle image is available at `/bootcamp/images/candle.png`.

The three emojis used are `üåê`, `üìß` and `üìû`.
Although this might look like a good target for a list with custom markers, it's probably best to use a collection of divs instead here.
The emojis have meaning and we want to preserve those for SEO and screenreaders, not simply make our bullet points pretty like we did with the Lemonade exercise.

When we're a little more advanced, we would probably want to use a list, with markers hidden, but still with the emojis inline, with descriptions added to them. We'll come to that later üôÇ

### CSS Properties Used

You will probably want to make use of all of the properties.

- `margin`: Should be a `px` value that is a multiple of 5 (e.g. `5px`, `10px`).
- `padding`: Should be a `px` value that is a multiple of 5 (e.g. `5px`, `10px`).
- `background-image: url(...)`: Sets a background image.
- `background-size`: Sets the size of the background image. Choose from `cover` or a `px` value (multiple of 5) in this exercise.
- `background-position`: Sets the position of the background image. This property has lots of options, but in this exercise, you need to choose two of `top`, `left`, `bottom` and `right` separated by a space (e.g. `background-position: top left`).
- `background-repeat`: Determines whether the background should repeat. To make it repeat, use `repeat`. To stop it from repeating, you can use the `no-repeat` value.
- `font-size`: Use `px` values.
- `font-weight`: You need `bold` for this exercise.
- `font-style`: You can use the `italic` value here.
- `color`: You need `#5b3a29` (heading) and `#8c6e54` (everything else).
- `border`: The border on the edge of the card is `double` with a color of `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)`.
- `border-radius`: Use a `px` value.

Remember to use the diff and curtain if you get stuck, and to **start styling from the top-left** to keep things sane!

<hr class="mt-40 mb-32 border-borderColor5"/>

## Stuck?

A lot of people get to 97% on this exercise, and can't get the last few percent correct.
That's normally because they've missed an instruction, or taken a more "hacky" approach to something than we're hoping to see.

Here are common mistakes people make.
I recommend double-checking each of them!

- Not checking the diff/curtain carefuly enough.
- Not using `cover`, `top left` and `repeat` for the paper background.
- Not using `px` for all margins and padding?
- Having slightly different corner radius (check the diff carefully).
- Not all pieces of text have the correct color.
- Not having the same padding all the way around. Instead people often have a different bottom padding, or try and use negative margins. This should feel a bit yucky - can you find a different way?
- Not specifying a border width when using the shorthand syntax.
- The emoji and the text next to it need to be spaced correctly. Think about how you can push two elements apart.
