# Raindrops

Raindrops is a version of the classic FizzBuzz challenge.
This is a programming exercise that's been used in interviews forever.

Your task is to convert a number into its corresponding raindrop sounds.

If a given number:

- is divisible by 3, add `"Pling"` to the result.
- is divisible by 5, add `"Plang"` to the result.
- is divisible by 7, add `"Plong"` to the result.
- is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, the result should be the number as a string.

### Examples

- 28 is divisible by 7, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be `"Plong"`.
- 30 is divisible by 3 and 5, but not 7, so the result would be `"PlingPlang"`.
- 34 is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be `"34"`.
