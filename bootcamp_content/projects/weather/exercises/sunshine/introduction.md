# Sunshine

The exercise introduces you to the `rectangle` and `fill_color_hex` functions.

### Drawing Circles

To draw circles, we use the `circle` function with 3 inputs:

- `cx`: The center position on the x axis (ie how far to the right the cetnter of the circle is).
- `cy`: The center position on the y axis (ie how far down the cetnter of the circle is).
- `radius`: The radius of the circle (half its width)

## Instructions

Your task is to draw a weather icon for a sunny day.
We've drawn the spikes of the sun, your job is to fill in the sun in the middle.
When it's finished it should look like this.

You'll need to use the following functions to draw things:

- `circle(center_x, center_y, radius)`

The circle should have a radius of 25 and be in the center of the image.
