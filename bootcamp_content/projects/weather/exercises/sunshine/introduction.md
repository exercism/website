# Sunshine

Your task is to draw a weather icon for a sunny day.
We've drawn the spikes of the sun, your job is to fill in the sun in the middle.
When it's finished it should look like this.

<img src="https://assets.exercism.org/bootcamp/graphics/sunshine-finished.png" style="width: 100%; max-width:400px;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:20px;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:5px"/>

You'll need to use the following functions to draw things:

- `circle(center_x, center_y, radius)`

The circle should have a radius of 25 and be in the center of the image.
