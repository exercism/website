# Wordle

Welcome to Wordle, the classic Lockdown game!

The game works like this:

- There is a correct secret word.
- You have 6 guesses to get it right.
- For each guess:
  - If a letter is correct, it goes green
  - If a letter is present in the word but in the wrong place, it goes yellow.
  - If a letter is missing, it goes grey.

## Instructions

Your job is to create two functions. The first is called `process_first_guess` and it should handle one guess. The second is `process_game` which should process the whole game.

### Process Guess

Create a function called `process_first_guess`.
It should take two inputs:

1. The secret target word.
2. The guess the player has made.

You should work out the state of each letter then call the `color_top_row(states)` function with a state for each square in the first row. Either: `"correct"`, `"present"`, or `"absent"`.

For example, if the word was correct, you would call:

```jikiscript
color_top_row(["correct", "correct", "correct", "correct", "correct"])
```

### Process Game

Create a function called `process_game`.
It should take two inputs:

1. The secret target word.
2. The list of the guesses the player has made. Each guess is a string.

You should work out the state of each row then call the `color_row(row, states)` function with the row (`1-6`), and a list of strings representing the state for each letter in the row.

For example, if the word was in the first row was correct, you would call:

```jikiscript
color_row(1, ["correct", "correct", "correct", "correct", "correct"])
```

## Custom Functions

This exercise might benefit from your [`my#contains`](/bootcamp/custom_functions/contains) custom function!

## Functions

You have one function available:

- `push(list, element)`: This adds an element to a list, then returns the new list. It does not change the original list.
