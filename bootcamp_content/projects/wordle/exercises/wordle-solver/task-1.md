# Task 1

The first scenario just expects you to choose the first word from the list.
That word is `"which"`.

To pass this scenario, you need to draw the board, then draw that word with the correct states (all `"correct"`).

You can check you are processing the guess correctly and have all your wiring correct before moving onto more complex situations.
