# Weather

## Overview

In this project, we'll build a fully fledged weather application, showing forecasts for the coming hours and days.

In Part 1, we'll start off by building some images to use, then crafting the various pieces of logic needed to make the app work.

In Part 2 of the course, you'll build the whole thing from scratch using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
