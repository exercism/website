# Wordle

## Overview

Welcome to Wordle, the classic Lockdown game!

The game works like this:

- There is a correct secret word.
- You have 6 guesses to get it right.
- For each guess:
  - If a letter is correct, it goes green
  - If a letter is present in the word but in the wrong place, it goes yellow.
  - If a letter is missing, it goes grey.

In Part 1, we'll implement the game logic.
In Part 2, we'll make it from scratch!
