      summary_heading: Summary
      summary_p1:
        Exercism is a not-for-profit organisation providing world-class
        programming education to anyone for free. Our online platform is centred
        around self-directed learning and volunteer mentoring, and has nearly
        one million members. Over the next 5 years, we want to become the
        defacto programming education platform that anyone, anywhere can use for
        free. Through our work we aim to improve the global standard of
        programming and increase participation in tech from under-represented
        groups. You can learn more about Exercism in our %{about_exercism_link}.
      summary_p1_link_text: '"About Exercism" pages'
      summary_p2:
        At the heart of Exercism is our content. We currently have thousands
        of programming exercises across over 50 programming languages, designed
        to teach and enable practice of programming concepts, nearly all of
        which has been written by our volunteer community. We want to support
        those exercises with world-class explanations of programming topics,
        written in an engaging, fun, conversational way. We need someone to lead
        on this, creating great content and supporting our volunteers in the
        content they create. This is a hands-on role where you'll be writing and
        editing content, while also working with our internal and senior
        community teams to design and plan out our content strategy.
      summary_p3:
        We are building an exceptional team of ambitious, passionate people
        who love their work, excel at what they do, and have fun doing it. The
        values of empathy, integrity and personal-growth are core to everything
        we do. If that sounds exciting to be part of, and you feel you have the
        skills to help, we'd love for you to apply.
      responsibilities_heading: Responsibilities
      responsibilities_p1: Your role splits roughly into three areas.
      responsibilities_p2: "The first is strategic, which has the following key responsibilities:"
      responsibilities_li1:
        Work with our senior team to design a content strategy
        that enables the creation of hundreds of brilliant programming articles.
      responsibilities_li2:
        Work with our senior maintainers to design and document
        systems that improve the flow and quality of content.
      responsibilities_li3:
        Work with our content partners (e.g. Packt Publishing) to
        determine synergies between their content and ours, and how we can make
        the most use of their educational portfolio.
      responsibilities_p3:
        The second role is actually writing educational content. As
        part of our three year plan, we are extending our content beyond content
        centred on programming languages, to content about programming in
        general - looking at fundamental programming concepts, design patterns,
        and the knowledge that makes someone an excellent programmer. You will
        lead this, planning out and writing the content, supported by both our
        internal team and our contributor team.
      responsibilities_p4: Thirdly we want to bring our content to life with
        illustrations, animations and video. While we don't expect you to be an
        artist or great behind the camera, you'll be largely responsible for
        finding and liasing with partners to make great content. If you are
        comfortable recording tutorials alongside the content, that will be a
        huge bonus too.
      right_for_you_heading: Is this job right for you?
      right_for_you_p1: The right person for this role will be someone who loves
        programming, is passionate about education, and who shares our values.
      right_for_you_p2:
        Central to this role is seeing content in the same way our
        founders do. We want to create content that embodies a sense of
        playfulness, fun, and approachability. We want our content to feel
        conversational, maybe even chatty - maybe more like a blog post than a
        formal teaching article. Articles will ideally include a lot of visuals.
        Everything we do is centred around making programming approachable,
        empowering, and never making anyone feel stupid.
      right_for_you_p3: "We’ve pulled out a couple of examples that we feel are
        aligned to where we want to take Exercism:"
      example_li1_link_text: How not to be stumped by trees
      example_li1_description: "- A great example of conversational content that
        teaches someone a concept in a fun way."
      example_li2_link_text: Fruit comparison
      example_li2_description: "- A nice example of how visuals can make an idea simple."
      example_li3_link_text: A crash course on JIT compilers
      example_li3_description:
        "- A great example of explaining a complex subject
        without making someone feel stupid."
      right_for_you_p4:
        If these pieces of content feel like the sort of things you'd
        enjoy writing, then we'd love you to apply. We don't expect you to be a
        programming expert and there will be lots of support around you to help
        explain topics you're not familiar with, but we do expect you to have
        some solid programming proficiency for this role.
      right_for_you_p5:
        You might be coming from a developer background wanting to use
        your knowledge in education, or maybe you're an educator and wanting to
        focus on programming education. Maybe programming has been a hobby for
        you and you want others to share in that same passion. We're entirely
        agnostic about your background, and don't require any specific academic
        qualifications. Our main criteria for hiring will be the belief that you
        will be able to execute in the role.
      right_for_you_p6:
        At Exercism, we have a shared commitment to kindness, honesty,
        and curiosity, and strive to build a working environment where everyone
        can learn, improve and do their best work. We believe that everyone has
        the right to feel happy, safe and supported at work, and strive to
        ensure that is the case at Exercism. We celebrate diversity, and do
        better work because of the different perspectives and insights that
        different experiences bring. It's important to us that you share these
        values and want to be part of a team living them out.
      right_for_you_p7: Finally, we want someone who can get passionate about
        Exercism. We are passionate about what we're building - about creating a
        world-class educational resource that everyone can use for free, and it
        matters to us that everyone in the team shares that passion.

      under_represented_groups_note: <em>Research has shown that people from
        under-represented groups are less likely to apply for jobs if they don't
        feel they fit <strong>all</strong> of the criteria. If you think you'd
        enjoy the role and could do a good job, but are not sure if you're fully
        qualified, please apply anyway!</em>
