      summary_heading: Summary
      summary_paragraph_1: Exercism is a not-for-profit organisation providing
        world-class programming education to anyone for free. Our online
        platform is centred around self-directed learning and volunteer
        mentoring, and has nearly one million members. Over the next 5 years, we
        want to become the defacto programming education platform that anyone,
        anywhere can use for free. Through our work we aim to improve the global
        standard of programming and increase participation in tech from
        under-represented groups. You can learn more about Exercism in our
        %{about_exercism_link}.
      about_exercism_link_text: '"About Exercism" pages'
      summary_paragraph_2:
        Exercism is a complex, highly-technical platform, with
        production code running in over 40 languages. From our users'
        perspective, however, it's an easy-to-use website that helps them
        improve their programming skills. We take pride in hiding all that
        complexity, and making Exercism feel as lightweight and beautiful as we
        can. We're looking for someone to take the lead in the continued
        development of Exercism's front-end, implementing designs to a
        pixel-perfect standard in CSS, and writing fast, performant and readable
        React code.
      summary_paragraph_3: We are building an exceptional team of ambitious,
        passionate people who love their work, excel at what they do, and have
        fun doing it. The values of empathy, integrity and personal-growth are
        core to everything we do. If that sounds exciting to be part, and you
        feel you have the skills to help, we'd love for you to apply.
      responsibilities_heading: Responsibilities
      responsibilities_intro: "You have two core responsibilities:"
      responsibility_item_1: Create performant interactive components in React.
      responsibility_item_2: Implementing designs to a pixel-perfect standard in HTML/CSS.
      responsibilities_first_year_intro:
        "As Exercism is a large and complex site,
        there is a huge variety in the things we work on day-to-day. Here is an
        idea of some of the things you'll work on through the first 12 months:"
      first_year_item_1: Creating a new UI for admins to manage automated mentoring
      first_year_item_2: Implementing dark-theme throughout the site
      first_year_item_3: Making the logged-in part of the website responsive
      first_year_item_4: Make the code editor "multiplayer"
      first_year_item_5: Add a section to allow people to create research profile
      first_year_item_6:
        Scan through %{open_issues_link} for an idea of what the
        community are hoping comes next!
      open_issues_link_text: open issues
      tech_stack_info:
        We use TypeScript, so it will help if you are comfortable with
        it. If you only know JavaScript, there's a small learning curve you'll
        need to take, which we will help you with. For CSS we use Tailwind. If
        you've not used it before then there is only a small learning-curve from
        CSS3 or another preprocessor such as SASS.
      team_collaboration_info:
        In addition to the technical work, you'll also work
        closely with rest of Exercism's team as we decide how to evolve the
        platform. We'll encourage you to get involved in our wider community, to
        tap into their collective knowledge and experience, but this isn't
        compulsary.
      right_for_you_heading: Is this job right for you?
      right_for_you_paragraph_1:
        The right person for this role will be someone who
        loves programming, is passionate about education, and who shares our
        values.
      right_for_you_paragraph_2:
        "At a technical level, we're not worried about your
        background or qualifications - what matters to us is that you'll be able
        to elevate the quality of Exercism. The easiest way to know if this is a
        good fit for you is to spend some time using Exercism and ask yourself
        two questions:"
      fit_question_1: Would I be excited to work on this?
      fit_question_2:
        Could I have developed this myself and done as good a job (or
        hopefully an even better one)?
      fit_questions_conclusion:
        "If the answer to those two questions is yes, then you
        probably have the requisite technical skills. What matters then is
        whether you'll enjoy working in our team. There are a few principles
        that underpin how we work. If these sound exciting to you, then you'll
        probably enjoy working with us:"
      work_principle_1:
        We take on high levels of personal responsibility and work
        autonomously. We discuss problems and ideas with other if we get stuck,
        but don't pair-program.
      work_principle_2:
        We have a strong tendency towards pragmatism, and tend to make
        decisions that optimize for the bigger picture over
        situational-perfection.
      work_principle_3:
        We write code that makes it easy for others in the team to
        work with. We choose standards and stick to them. We generally
        prioritize developer-happiness over technical optimisation.
      work_principle_4:
        We are dedicated to continous personal development. We each
        have intrinsic drives to learn, grow and elevate our standards.
      work_principle_5:
        We believe and trust in each other, support each other, and
        make time for each other.
      values_commitment:
        In additon to these things, our whole team have a shared
        commitment to kindness, honesty, and curiosity, and strive to build a
        working environment where everyone can learn, improve and do their best
        work. We believe that everyone has the right to feel happy, safe and
        supported at work, and strive to ensure that is the case at Exercism. We
        celebrate diversity, and do better work because of the different
        perspectives and insights that different experiences bring. It's
        important to us that you share these values and want to be part of a
        team living them out.
      passion_for_exercism:
        Finally, we want to hire someone who can get passionate
        about Exercism. We care deeply about what we're building - about
        creating a world-class educational resource that everyone can use for
        free, and it matters to us that everyone in the team shares that
        passion.
