        Become Exercism's new Rails developer! We're looking for some
        who loves working with Ruby and Rails to continue to develop Exercism's
        backend. Do you take pride in building well-architected, performant and
        readable Rails code? Do you enjoy working with Ruby more widely too? Do
        you have a passion for programming and a growth mindset? If so, this
        role might be perfect for you.
      summary_heading: Summary
      summary_para1:
        Exercism is a not-for-profit organisation providing world-class
        programming education to anyone for free. Our online platform is centred
        around self-directed learning and volunteer mentoring, and has nearly
        one million members. Over the next 5 years, we want to become the
        defacto programming education platform that anyone, anywhere can use for
        free. Through our work we aim to improve the global standard of
        programming and increase participation in tech from under-represented
        groups. You can learn more about Exercism in our
        %{about_exercism_link_html}.
      about_exercism_link_text: About Exercism pages
      summary_para2:
        Exercism is a complex, highly-technical platform, with production
        code running in over 40 languages. Our backend is centered around a Ruby
        on Rails backend (API, data and service layers) and a service oriented
        architecture (SOA) orchestrated using Ruby. We run on AWS and use a
        variety of their different technologies. We're looking for someone to
        take the lead in the continued development of Exercism's backend,
        implementing new features in the main Rails app, and extending our SOA
        with new functionality.
      summary_para3:
        We are building an exceptional team of ambitious, passionate
        people who love their work, excel at what they do, and have fun doing
        it. The values of empathy, integrity and personal-growth are core to
        everything we do. If that sounds exciting to be part of, and you feel
        you have the skills to help, we'd love for you to apply.
      responsibilities_heading: Responsibilities
      responsibilities_para1:
        You'll be our primary backend developer, working with
        our team to add new features to Exercism's platform, and evolving and
        improving the ones that are already there. This will involve working
        within our Rails codebase, our various microservices (and the piping
        between them) and working with our AWS account.
      responsibilities_para2:
        "As Exercism is a large and complex site, there is a
        huge variety in the things we work on day-to-day. Here is an idea of
        some of the things you'll work on through the first 12 months:"
      responsibility_item1:
        Working with the front-end dev to build our new automated
        mentoring management system.
      responsibility_item2:
        Moving from our current mail provider to SES, writing a
        webhooks API to store underlying deliverability data (and saving us 90%
        costs on email!)
      responsibility_item3: Developing out a prototype for our new Exercism Teams platform.
      responsibility_item4: Adding a variety of action/reaction mechanisms to improve retention.
      responsibility_item5:
        Working through many of the %{open_issues_link_html} that
        our community have opened.
      open_issues_link_text: open issues
      working_with_intro: "You'll be working day-to-day with:"
      working_with_item1:
        Our Head of Open Source, who manages our wider codebase
        (written in 30 languages) and its integration points into the primary
        backend.
      working_with_item2: Our front-end developer, whose React code consumes the
        backend API and presents it to our end-users.
      working_with_item3:
        Our CEO, who has written most of the existing Rails backend,
        and will continue to contribute features from time-to-time.
      responsibilities_para3:
        We'll also encourage you to get involved in our wider
        community, to tap into their collective knowledge and experience, but
        this isn't compulsory.
      technical_fit_heading: Is this job right for you technically?
      technical_fit_para1:
        The right person for this role will be someone who loves
        programming, is passionate about education, and who shares our values.
        We're not worried about your qualifications - what matters to us is that
        you'll be able to do a great job of developing our backend.
      technical_skills_intro: "From a technical perspective, we're looking for someone who has:"
      technical_skill_item1:
        Strong Ruby and Rails skills. You should have worked on
        Rails codebases and solved meaningful problems in Rails. You should
        "get" Rails, feel comfortable in it, and enjoy using it. You should
        understand "why" things work as they do - for example do you "get" how
        Zeitwerk works?
      technical_skill_item2:
        A fundamental belief in the importance of writing good
        tests. We generally encourage using TDD, where sensible. At Exercism we
        use minitest, not spec-based tests.
      technical_skill_item3:
        An interest in performant SQL (we use MySQL). We can help
        get you up to speed if you've not got much experience in this area, but
        we'd like you to care about it.
      technical_skill_item4:
        Ideally some experience with AWS. We use Terraform to
        build our infrastructure (%{terraform_code_link_html}). Experience here
        isn't essential, but it would be good to have someone who has an
        interest in learning this, even if they haven't done much before.
      terraform_code_link_text: code here
      codebase_patterns_para:
        One important consideration is that our codebase has
        several strong conventions and patterns that we use consistently in both
        our Rails and Ruby apps. At a fundamental level, they revolve around us
        taking a more functional approach to Ruby and making use of the command
        pattern. In Rails we have small controllers, small models, and
        functionality encapsulated into specifically callable function-style
        classes. We prefer this approach as it allows developers to clearly see
        the side-effects of code, but it is in stark-contrast with the more
        Object Oriented approach that many organisations take with Ruby. For
        example, %{controller_link_html} calls %{command_link_html} to generate
        the data that is passed to %{serializers_link1_html}
        %{serializers_link2_html} serializers to present the data to the user.
        This results in the %{track_model_link_html} being pretty slimline. We
        love working with these patterns, and it's important that you're going
        to enjoy working with them too!
      controller_action_link_text: this controller action
      command_link_text: this command
      serializers_link1_text: these
      serializers_link2_text: two
      track_model_link_text: Track model
      codebase_review_warning:
        Before applying, please take time to look through the
        %{codebase_link_html} to see if it looks like something you want to work
        within. We will discuss your thoughts on the codebase further if you
        make it to the interview stage.
      codebase_link_text: website's codebase
      personal_fit_heading: Is this job right for you personally?
      personal_fit_intro:
        "Even more than the technical considerations, it matters
        that you'll enjoy working in our team. There are a few principles that
        underpin how we work. If these sound exciting to you, then you'll
        probably enjoy working with us:"
      personal_fit_item1:
        We take on high levels of personal responsibility and work
        autonomously. We discuss problems and ideas with other if we get stuck,
        but don't pair-program.
      personal_fit_item2:
        We have a strong tendency towards pragmatism, and tend to
        make decisions that optimize for the bigger picture over
        situational-perfection.
      personal_fit_item3:
        We write code that makes it easy for others in the team to
        work with. We choose standards and stick to them. We generally
        prioritize developer-happiness over technical optimisation.
      personal_fit_item4:
        We are dedicated to continous personal development. We each
        have intrinsic drives to learn, grow and elevate our standards.
      personal_fit_item5:
        We believe and trust in each other, support each other, and
        make time for each other.
      values_para:
        In additon to these things, our whole team have a shared commitment
        to kindness, honesty, and curiosity, and strive to build a working
        environment where everyone can learn, improve and do their best work. We
        believe that everyone has the right to feel happy, safe and supported at
        work, and strive to ensure that is the case at Exercism. We celebrate
        diversity, and do better work because of the different perspectives and
        insights that different experiences bring. It's important to us that you
        share these values and want to be part of a team living them out.
      passion_para:
        Finally, we want to hire someone who can get passionate about
        Exercism. We care deeply about what we're building - about creating a
        world-class educational resource that everyone can use for free, and it
        matters to us that everyone in the team shares that passion.
