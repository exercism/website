          title: Have Fun

      principles_section:
        title: Principles
        principle_1: Exercism should be enjoyable, challenging and valuable.
        principle_2:
          Exercism should encourage a growth-mindset, clear and empathetic
          communication, and emphasize the value in learning together.
        principle_3: Exercism should feel safe and nurturing.
        principle_4:
          Exercism focusses on the learning journey, not the destination. The
          process and enjoyment of learning is more important than absolute
          factual correctness.

        title: How Exercism is run
        description:
          Exercism is developed through a mixture of top-down leadership and
          a collaborative community. We believe that most decisions are worth
          their taking time over, and so we think hard before we act.
        reflective:
          title: Reflective
          description:
            We focus on being strategy-driven and product-driven, looking to
            the long term, not just the immediate impact, and considering the
            holistic impact of decisions. We work closely with key volunteer
            contributors to canvas opinions and knowledge, understanding our
            strengths and weaknesses and trying to improve Exercism daily, while
            also staying focussed on our long-term vision.

          title: A small team with a big vision
          description:
            We also place a high focus on quality. We want what we do to be
            good - to work well, be accessible to all, and to be innovative. We
            have a tiny core team who take responsibility for ensuring that
            Exercism grows and evolves in line with its vision. Through
            donations from our community, philanthropists and philanthropic
            foundations, we are expanding our team in a sustainable and
            responsible way. We have funding milestones that we publicize and
            fundraise towards, which allow us to hire more people to develop
            further.
        ethics:
          title: Grounded in ethics
          description:
            We try to pay fairly, respecting and considering both the time and
            value of our staff and the generosity of our donors. We act
            ethically as a company and as an employer, treating our team with
            respect and never asking something of them that we wouldn’t do
            ourselves, and not using techniques or technologies that we wouldn't
            want used on us.
