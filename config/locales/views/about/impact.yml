          %{twitter_handle} is really incredible. My submission was failing its tests…
          I asked for mentoring to help straighten things out, and within 15 minutes
          someone had messaged me explaining my error.
        zippkode_html: >-
          …I worked on the Ruby strings exercises at %{twitter_handle} This
          platform forces me to slow down and actually logically solve the
          tasks…
        alebaffa_html: >-
          I've always loved %{twitter_handle} because you learn not only the
          syntax of a language, but also its dev environment: how to setup
          tests, packaging and build. Fantastic resource!
