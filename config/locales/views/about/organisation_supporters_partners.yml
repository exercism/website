        title: Support from our funders is crucial to achieving Exercism's goals
        paragraph1:
          While much of Exercism is run by our volunteer community, the
          website and core infrastructure are managed by a full-time team.
        paragraph2:
          We also undertake specific larger projects, such as the development
          of our automated analyzers, which require a committed team working
          more intensely on something over a fixed period of time.
        paragraph3:
          In order to fund this core team and these products we rely on grant
          funding from companies or organisation that wish to contribute to our
          vision of helping providing free programming education for everyone.

        about_gobridge_description:
          <strong>%{gobridge_text}</strong>'s mission is to
          enable minorities in tech to use Go as a tool to learn and teach
          programming and, ultimately, to empower underrepresented groups in
          tech to help increase diversity in the Go community. That fits
          perfectly with our mission of providing opportunity through the
          development of programming, and so we're really excited to be able to
          launch this partnership. <strong>%{gobridge_text}</strong> and the
          <strong>%{go_developer_network_text}</strong> will be promoting
          Exercism across their networks, and we'll be hoping for a large influx
          of both Go mentors and students.
