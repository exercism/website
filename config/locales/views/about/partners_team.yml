        about_packt_publishing: About Packt Publishing
        packt_about_p1:
          Packt is a tech publisher focused on the practical application
          of technology. Packt authors are mostly working developers who do the
          job of sorting out what actually works and how to get things done with
          the endless stream of new technology. Packt readers and users are busy
          working engineers building solutions and applications, who want to
          know whether how a technology works in practice, and whether it’s
          worth using.
        packt_about_p2:
          Packt supports Exercism in its mission to ease the path to
          fluency across languages. We share the Exercism values of independence
          from any one platform or language, and the belief in the desire of
          engineers to support and help each other as a peer community. Packt
          books and publishing aim to provide a structured body of practical
          knowledge to complement fantastic platforms like Exercism. We both
          provide a way for experienced professionals to share knowledge and
          experience with the tech broader community.
