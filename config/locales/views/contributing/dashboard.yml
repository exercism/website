              tag: Project
              description:
                Test runners power our online editor. All tracks have basic test
                runners, but many need more advanced features and functionality
                adding.

              title: Develop an analyzer
              tag: Project
              description:
                Analyzers give automated feedback to students through ASTs
                analysis. These are complex and deeply interesting pieces of
                software to develop.

              description:
                Representers help us spot identical solutions so that we can reuse
                feedback. Simpler than analyzers but fun and interesting to
                reason about.
