        q1:
          summary: Is the only way to access Insiders through donating?
          p1_html:
            The most common way to access insiders is through a regular donation.
            Regular contributors get Insiders access for free, and it's also
            possible to get Lifetime Insiders membership for significant
            donations or contributions. You can check the exact algorithm
            %{codebase_link} but it's also reproduced here.
          codebase_link_text: in our codebase
          p2: "To gain lifetime access you need one of the following:"
          li1: To be a founder or staff member
          li2:
            To be a supermentor (100+ solutions mentored on a track with a 95% positive
            rating)
          li3: To have a reputation equal or greater than 1,000
          li4: To have donated $499 (in one chunk or many parts)
          p3:
            "For those without lifetime access, to gain access you need one of the
            following:"
          li5: To have a recurring monthly donation of $10 or more.
          li6: To be a maintainer
          li7:
            To have earned 30 reputation in the last 30 days, or 200 reputation in the
            last 365 days (not including reputation for publishing solutions)
          li8:
            To have had a recurring donation at the point that Insiders launched (May
            30th 2023), and it still to be active.
          li9:
            For donations before we launched Insiders, you get one month of Insiders
            for every $9.99 donated, from the date that Insiders launched, plus
            one extra bonus month. So if you donated $35 before Insiders
            launched, you'd get Insiders access through June, July, August and
            September 2023.
          li10: One off donations of $10 or more give 1 months access.

          summary: What does Insiders cost?
          description:
            Insiders isn't a product that you can buy - it's our way of saying
            thank you for those who contribute, mentor or donate. The easiest
            way to get Insiders access is by setting up a regular monthly
            donation of $10 or more.
        q4:
          summary: Is Insiders the same as Premium?
          description:
            Exercism Premium was discontinued in August 2023. All Premium
            members were migrated to have Exercism Insider status and their
            monthly payments converted to recurring donations.
        q5:
          summary: How do I earn reputation?
          p1_html:
            Reputation is earned by mentoring or contributing to Exercism. You can
            also earn reputation by publishing your solutions, but that does not
            count towards Insiders access. You can check what actions result in
            what reputation by consulting %{docs_link}.
