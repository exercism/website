      faq_access:
        question: Is the only way to access Insiders through donating?
        answer_part1_html:
          The most common way to access insiders is through a regular
          donation. Regular contributors get Insiders access for free, and it's
          also possible to get Lifetime Insiders membership for significant
          donations or contributions. You can check the exact algorithm <a
          href="%{codebase_link}">in our codebase</a> but it's also reproduced
          here.
        lifetime_access_intro: "To gain lifetime access you need one of the following:"
        lifetime_criterion_founder: To be a founder or staff member
        lifetime_criterion_supermentor:
          To be a supermentor (100+ solutions mentored on
          a track with a 95% positive rating)
        lifetime_criterion_reputation: To have a reputation equal or greater than 1,000
        lifetime_criterion_donation: To have donated $499 (in one chunk or many parts)
        temporary_access_intro:
          "For those without lifetime access, to gain access you
          need one of the following:"
        temporary_criterion_monthly_donation: To have a recurring monthly donation of $10 or more.
        temporary_criterion_maintainer: To be a maintainer
        temporary_criterion_recent_reputation:
          To have earned 30 reputation in the last
          30 days, or 200 reputation in the last 365 days (not including
          reputation for publishing solutions)
        temporary_criterion_legacy_donation:
          To have had a recurring donation at the
          point that Insiders launched (May 30th 2023), and it still to be
          active.
        temporary_criterion_one_off_donation:
          For donations before we launched Insiders,
          you get one month of Insiders for every $9.99 donated, from the date
          that Insiders launched, plus one extra bonus month. So if you donated
          $35 before Insiders launched, you'd get Insiders access through June,
          July, August and September 2023.

        question: I've donated via Paypal or GitHub Sponsors but don't have access.
        answer_html: Sometimes the tech breaks down and we don't get webhook
          notifications from GitHub or Paypal. If you have issues, please <a

      faq_cost:
        question: What does Insiders cost?
        answer:
          Insiders isn't a product that you can buy - it's our way of saying thank
          you for those who contribute, mentor or donate. The easiest way to get
          Insiders access is by setting up a regular monthly donation of $10 or
          more.
      faq_premium:
        question: Is Insiders the same as Premium?
        answer:
          Exercism Premium was discontinued in August 2023. All Premium members
          were migrated to have Exercism Insider status and their monthly
          payments converted to recurring donations.
      faq_reputation:
        question: How do I earn reputation?
        answer_html:
          Reputation is earned by mentoring or contributing to Exercism. You
          can also earn reputation by publishing your solutions, but that does
          not count towards Insiders access. You can check what actions result
          in what reputation by consulting <a href="%{docs_link}">our docs</a>.
          Check your <a href="%{journey_link}">journey page</a> to see where
          you're earning reputation.
