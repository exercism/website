          title: FAQs
          what_it_involves_question: What does being a translator involve?
          what_it_involves_answer:
            Translators will help us translate the Exercism
            website, documentation, and other content into their chosen
            languages. This will involve translating text, reviewing
            translations, and ensuring that the content is culturally
            appropriate and accurate. We are generating machine translations
            first then asking translators to review and improve them.
          time_commitment_question: How much time will it take?
          time_commitment_answer:
            You can spend as much time as you're willing to give to
            the project. We are hoping to build large teams of translators for
            each language, who can work together to quickly give us a great
            first version.
          payment_reward_question: Is there any payment or reward?
          payment_reward_answer_html:
            All of Exercism's content is created by volunteers
            who give their time to help others. Like other parts of the site,
            there is no financial reward for helping, but you will
            <strong>receive Exercism Reputation</strong> which boosts your
            public profile!
          when_start_question: When do we start?
          when_start_answer:
            Soon! We're currently finishing building the UI you'll use,
            and creating our initial machine-translations. We hope to be ready
            near the start of September for you!
