          Hey there,


          I hope you're enjoying Exercism so far! Did you know that we're a
          not-for-profit organisation? We want everyone to be able to benefit
          from Exercism, no matter how much money they have, so we keep the site
          100% free.


          To do that, we rely on donations of those that can afford it to keep
          Exercism running. We're an extremely lean operation and considering we
          serve over 1.5 million people, we have very low costs (~$250k/year). I
          put a video together that explains more: %{insiders_url}


          If you do find Exercism useful and if you can afford to do so, please
          support us by making a donation. However, if you can't afford it,
          please know that this is not a requirement and our platform will
          always be available to you for free.


          Your support, whether through a donation or simply spreading the word
          about Exercism, is critical in helping us achieve our social mission.
          Every bit counts and helps us bring quality programming education to
          more people around the world.


          Thank you for being a part of our community and for supporting our
          social mission. We look forward to seeing all the amazing things you
          will achieve with Exercism.

          Hey there,


          It's been a day or so since you signed up to Exercism, and I wanted to
          check how you're getting on so far?


          Sometimes Exercism can be a bit overwhelming at first. Some people get
          a bit lost and things don't quite make sense to them.

          If you get stuck, check out our Discord
          (https://exercism.org/r/discord) or Forum
          (https://exercism.org/r/forum), where you can ask for help.

          It's always helpful for us to know where people are tripping up so we
          can fix it, so please don't be afraid to speak up!


          If you've not started exploring a language yet, we have over 65 to
          choose from, including the most widely used languages (e.g. Python,
          JavaScript, C#), the popular new-kids on the block (e.g. Go, Elixir,
          Rust) and some quite unusual and esotoric languages (e.g. 8th, COBOL,
          Prolog).

          There's tons to learn and a lot of fun to be had!


          And as a final a reminder, Exercism is 100% free, open-source and not
          for profit. Enjoy!


          Best regards,


          Jeremy Walker

          Receiving feedback from our mentors is an amazing way of discovering

          absolutely free!


          Choose a solution that you feel has the most room for improvement and
          request a mentor to take a look at it. They should get back to you
          within a day or so with some ideas!
