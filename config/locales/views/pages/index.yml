          knowledge_gaps_description:
            When learning a new language, the hardest part is
            not being aware of the gaps in your knowledge. Our mentors can look
            at your code and immediately see the ideas you're not familiar
            with and give you a level-up by unlocking new knowledge.
          conventions_title: Learn language-specific conventions
          conventions_description:
            Becoming fluent in a language is more than being able
            to write code in it - it's about being able to think in that
            language. Our mentors will help guide you to how to reshape your
            thinking to write idiomatic code.
          learning_fun_title: Learning with others is fun
          learning_fun_description:
            Getting feedback from real people is an amazingly
            exciting way to learn. And becoming a mentor and giving feedback
            yourself is an even bigger step forward. So complete the circle - be
            mentored and mentor ðŸŽ‰
