            Every language has its own way of doing things. %{track_title}
            is no different. Our mentors will help you learn to think like a
            %{track_title} developer and how to write idiomatic code in
            %{track_title}. Once you've solved an exercise, submit it to our
            volunteer team, and they'll give you hints, ideas, and feedback on
            how to make it feel more like what you'd normally see in
            %{track_title} - they'll help you discover the things you don't know
            that you don't know.
