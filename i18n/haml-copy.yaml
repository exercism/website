          is no different. Our mentors will help you learn to think like a
          %{track_title} developer and how to write idiomatic code in
          %{track_title}. Once you've solved an exercise, submit it to our
          volunteer team, and they'll give you hints, ideas, and feedback on
          how to make it feel more like what you'd normally see in
          %{track_title} - they'll help you discover the things you don't know

        While much of Exercism is run by our volunteer community, the website
        and core infrastructure are managed by a full-time team.
      paragraph2:
        We also undertake specific larger projects, such as the development
        of our automated analyzers, which require a committed team working more intensely
        on something over a fixed period of time.
      paragraph3:
        In order to fund this core team and these products we rely on grant
        funding from companies or organisation that wish to contribute to our vision
        of helping providing free programming education for everyone.

      about_gobridge_description:
        "<strong>%{gobridge_text}</strong>'s mission is
        to enable minorities in tech to use Go as a tool to learn and teach programming
        and, ultimately, to empower underrepresented groups in tech to help increase
        diversity in the Go community. That fits perfectly with our mission of providing
        opportunity through the development of programming, and so we're really excited
        to be able to launch this partnership. <strong>%{gobridge_text}</strong> and
        the <strong>%{go_developer_network_text}</strong> will be promoting Exercism
        across their networks, and we'll be hoping for a large influx of both Go mentors
        and students."

        title: Support from our funders is crucial to achieving Exercism's goals
        paragraph1:
          While much of Exercism is run by our volunteer community, the
          website and core infrastructure are managed by a full-time team.
        paragraph2:
          We also undertake specific larger projects, such as the development
          of our automated analyzers, which require a committed team working more
          intensely on something over a fixed period of time.
        paragraph3:
          In order to fund this core team and these products we rely on
          grant funding from companies or organisation that wish to contribute to
          our vision of helping providing free programming education for everyone.

      about_packt_publishing: About Packt Publishing
      packt_about_p1:
        Packt is a tech publisher focused on the practical application
        of technology. Packt authors are mostly working developers who do the job
        of sorting out what actually works and how to get things done with the endless
        stream of new technology. Packt readers and users are busy working engineers
        building solutions and applications, who want to know whether how a technology
        works in practice, and whether it’s worth using.
      packt_about_p2:
        Packt supports Exercism in its mission to ease the path to fluency
        across languages. We share the Exercism values of independence from any one
        platform or language, and the belief in the desire of engineers to support
        and help each other as a peer community. Packt books and publishing aim to
        provide a structured body of practical knowledge to complement fantastic platforms
        like Exercism. We both provide a way for experienced professionals to share
        knowledge and experience with the tech broader community.

        Exercism is developed through a mixture of top-down leadership

        title: Reflective
        description:
          We focus on being strategy-driven and product-driven, looking
          to the long term, not just the immediate impact, and considering the holistic
          impact of decisions. We work closely with key volunteer contributors to
          canvas opinions and knowledge, understanding our strengths and weaknesses
          and trying to improve Exercism daily, while also staying focussed on our
          long-term vision.

          a tiny core team who take responsibility for ensuring that Exercism grows
          and evolves in line with its vision. Through donations from our community,
          philanthropists and philanthropic foundations, we are expanding our team
          in a sustainable and responsible way. We have funding milestones that we
          publicize and fundraise towards, which allow us to hire more people to develop

          or technologies that we wouldn't want used on us.

    faqs_heading: The Nitty Gritty & FAQs
    faq_access:
      question: Is the only way to access Insiders through donating?
      answer_part1_html:
        The most common way to access insiders is through a regular
        donation. Regular contributors get Insiders access for free, and it's also
        possible to get Lifetime Insiders membership for significant donations or
        contributions. You can check the exact algorithm <a href="%{codebase_link}">in
        our codebase</a> but it's also reproduced here.
      lifetime_access_intro: "To gain lifetime access you need one of the following:"
      lifetime_criterion_founder: To be a founder or staff member
      lifetime_criterion_supermentor:
        To be a supermentor (100+ solutions mentored
        on a track with a 95% positive rating)
      lifetime_criterion_reputation: To have a reputation equal or greater than 1,000
      lifetime_criterion_donation: To have donated $499 (in one chunk or many parts)
      temporary_access_intro:
        "For those without lifetime access, to gain access you
        need one of the following:"
      temporary_criterion_monthly_donation:
        To have a recurring monthly donation of
        $10 or more.
      temporary_criterion_maintainer: To be a maintainer
      temporary_criterion_recent_reputation:
        To have earned 30 reputation in the last
        30 days, or 200 reputation in the last 365 days (not including reputation
        for publishing solutions)
      temporary_criterion_legacy_donation:
        To have had a recurring donation at the
        point that Insiders launched (May 30th 2023), and it still to be active.
      temporary_criterion_one_off_donation:
        For donations before we launched Insiders,
        you get one month of Insiders for every $9.99 donated, from the date that
        Insiders launched, plus one extra bonus month. So if you donated $35 before
        Insiders launched, you'd get Insiders access through June, July, August and
        September 2023.
      support_html:
        If you think you meet these criteria but don't have access, please
        <a href="%{forum_issue_link}">open a forum issue</a> and someone will help
        you out! If you've donated via Paypal or GitHub Sponsors but don't have access,
        please see the next question.
    faq_paypal_github:
      question: I've donated via Paypal or GitHub Sponsors but don't have access.
      answer_html:
        Sometimes the tech breaks down and we don't get webhook notifications
        from GitHub or Paypal. If you have issues, please <a href="%{forum_issue_link}">open
        a forum issue</a> and someone will help you out!
    faq_cost:
      question: What does Insiders cost?
      answer:
        Insiders isn't a product that you can buy - it's our way of saying thank
        you for those who contribute, mentor or donate. The easiest way to get Insiders
        access is by setting up a regular monthly donation of $10 or more.
    faq_premium:
      question: Is Insiders the same as Premium?
      answer:
        Exercism Premium was discontinued in August 2023. All Premium members
        were migrated to have Exercism Insider status and their monthly payments converted
        to recurring donations.
    faq_reputation:
      question: How do I earn reputation?
      answer_html:
        Reputation is earned by mentoring or contributing to Exercism.
        You can also earn reputation by publishing your solutions, but that does not
        count towards Insiders access. You can check what actions result in what reputation
        by consulting <a href="%{docs_link}">our docs</a>. Check your <a href="%{journey_link}">journey
        page</a> to see where you're earning reputation.

        title: FAQs
        what_it_involves_question: What does being a translator involve?
        what_it_involves_answer:
          Translators will help us translate the Exercism website,
          documentation, and other content into their chosen languages. This will
          involve translating text, reviewing translations, and ensuring that the
          content is culturally appropriate and accurate. We are generating machine
          translations first then asking translators to review and improve them.
        time_commitment_question: How much time will it take?
        time_commitment_answer:
          You can spend as much time as you're willing to give
          to the project. We are hoping to build large teams of translators for each
          language, who can work together to quickly give us a great first version.
        payment_reward_question: Is there any payment or reward?
        payment_reward_answer_html:
          All of Exercism's content is created by volunteers
          who give their time to help others. Like other parts of the site, there
          is no financial reward for helping, but you will <strong>receive Exercism
          Reputation</strong> which boosts your public profile!
        when_start_question: When do we start?
        when_start_answer:
          Soon! We're currently finishing building the UI you'll
          use, and creating our initial machine-translations. We hope to be ready
          near the start of September for you!
